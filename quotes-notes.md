> The trouble about reading the papers first when you go into a new field, you think the right thing to do would be to read what everybody else has said about it.  If you do that, you finish out accepting their questions as well as their answers as being what matters in that subject.  And maybe they're wrong.  Maybe they're asking the wrong questions.  If you go into it ignorant like I do, and read as little as possible and plunge in and try and solve things, occasionally you make a complete idiot of yourself, and I do that quite often but I don't mind too much, people are used to it by now. But occasionally I ask a question that other people haven't asked and provide an answer that other people haven't answered, and you know, that's much more fun.
