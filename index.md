## [Kaggle Ship Detection Challenge](airbus.html)

This post follows my development of a dense ship segmenter for Kaggle's Ship Detection Challenge.  The basic pipeline consists of a ship/noship CNN followed by a Unet and some post-processing.

## [Exploring the First-Link Taxonomy of Wikipedia](wikilinks.html)

An interesting property of Wikipedia is that each page's first-link often goes to its immediate superset.  For example, 'poker' first-links to 'card game' and 'card game' first-links to 'game', etc.  Where do all these first-links go?  And what does the first-link taxonomy of Wikipedia look like?

## [Satellite Image Classification on the fMoW Dataset](fmow.html)

This post documents the use of CNNs for satellite image classification on The Functional Map of the World dataset. I look at fine-tuning, the effect of sample size distribution, and the effect of adding spatial context.

## [Reinforcement Learning IRL](rl.html)

This post describes an Arduino robot that learns to crawl using Q-learning.  Included is a video/tutorial showing the robot in action.

## [Discovering Class-Hierarchies by Clustering Confusion Matrices](cm-clustering.html)

This is an example showing how class hierarchies can be discovered by applying spectral clustering to a confusion matrix.

## [Artificial Life, Neural Nets, and Genetic Algorithms](neuroev.html)

Can neural nets control Artificial Life agents?  Can genetic algorithms optimize such neural nets?  In this post a GA called Enforced Subpopulations is implemented to show that _yes_ GAs can optimize NNs, and _yes_ NNs can effectively control AL agents.

## [Solving Threes](bellman.md)

Threes is a dice game definitely worth knowing.  Do _you_ know how to play Threes?  Do _you_ know how to win at Threes?  Here I explain the rules of Threes and use backward induction to find its optimal policy.
