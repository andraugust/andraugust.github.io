## [TLDR: CNN Texture Bias](cnn-texture-bias.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">01/2021</p>
Notes on the paper "ImageNet-trained CNNs are biased toward texture; increasing shape bias increases accuracy and robustness" by Geirhos et al, 2019.


## [PlatformIO Notes](platformio-notes.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">02/2020</p>
PlatformIO is a nice IDE for Arduino that allows you to specify environments and upload sketches via the command line, but more importantly it has code completion and real-time code inspections, which the default Arduino IDE doesn't have.  Here are some notes on using PlatformIO.

## [The Hiring Problem](hiring-problem.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">09/2019</p>
Suppose you're interviewing candidates for a job. Interviews come at a cost, but they provide useful information about candidates. How many candidates should you interview if you want to select the best one and minimize cost?

## [Neural Style Transfer](neural-style-transfer.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">02/2019</p>
This post is about transferring style from one image to another using neural networks.

## [Kaggle Ship Detection Challenge](airbus.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">11/2018</p>
This is my segmentation model for Kaggle's Ship Detection Challenge.  The pipeline consists of a ship/noship classifier followed by a U-net and some post-processing.

## [The First-Link Taxonomy of Wikipedia](wikilinks.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">04/2018</p>
An interesting property of Wikipedia is that the first link on most pages will go to that page's immediate superset.  For example, _poker_ goes to _card game_, _card game_ goes to _game_, etc.  Where do these first-links lead?  And what does the first-link taxonomy look like?

## [Satellite Image Classification on the FMoW Dataset](fmow.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">12/2017</p>
This post is about using CNNs to classify objects in The Functional Map of the World dataset. I look at fine-tuning, the effect of sample size distribution, and the effect of including spatial context.

## [Discovering Class-Hierarchies by Clustering Confusion Matrices](cm-clustering.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">10/2017</p>
This is an example of how spectral clustering can be applied to confusion matrices to find class hierarchies.

## [Solving Threes](bellman.md)

<p style="opacity:0.5">03/2016</p>
Here I derive the optimal policy for the dice game _Threes_.

## [Artificial Life, Neural Nets, and Genetic Algorithms](neuroev.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">11/2015</p>
Can neural nets successfully control Artificial Life agents?  Can genetic algorithms optimize such nets?  In this post I implement a genetic algorithm called Enforced Subpopulations to show that yes, yes they can.

## [Reinforcement Learning IRL](rl.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">12/2014</p>
This is an Arduino robot I made that learns how to crawl using reinforcement learning.  Included is a video tutorial about RL and how it was adapted for the robot.

## [Cheatsheet](cheatsheet.html)
