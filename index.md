<p style="opacity:0.5">01/2021</p>
A summary of the paper _ImageNet-trained CNNs are biased toward texture; increasing shape bias increases accuracy and robustness_ by Geirhos et al, 2019.

## [PlatformIO Notes](platformio-notes.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">02/2020</p>
PlatformIO is an IDE for Arduino that supports environments and command-line uploads, but more importantly it has code completion and inspections, which the default Arduino IDE doesn't have.

## [The Hiring Problem](hiring-problem.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">09/2019</p>
A toy problem about optimizing the trade-off between information collection and lost opportunity, in the context of hiring job applicants.

## [Neural Style Transfer](neural-style-transfer.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">02/2019</p>
What defines the _style_ of an image? Can it be captured computationally? If so, is it possible to transfer styles from one image another, like making a selfie appear to be painted by Van Gogh?

<p style="opacity:0.5">11/2018</p>
Detecting ships in sattelite images, from a Kaggle challenge.

## [The First Link Taxonomy of Wikipedia](wikilinks.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">04/2018</p>
The first link on most Wikipedia pages goes to the next most general thing. "Poker" goes to "card game", "card game" goes to "game", etc.  Where do all these first links finally lead? Does Wikipedia's have something like a first-link taxonomy?
