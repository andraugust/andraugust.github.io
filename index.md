## [Connect PyCharm to Remote Server](pycharm-remote.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">01/2019</p>

Reference for how to connect PyCharm to a remote machine.

## [Kaggle Ship Detection Challenge](airbus.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">11/2018</p>

This post documents my dense ship segmenter for Kaggle's Ship Detection Challenge.  The basic pipeline consists of a ship/noship CNN followed by a Unet and some post-processing.

## [Exploring the First-Link Taxonomy of Wikipedia](wikilinks.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">04/2018</p>

An interesting property of Wikipedia pages is that their first-links often go to their immediate supersets.  For example, _poker_ first-links to _card game_ and _card game_ first-links to _game_, etc.  Where do all these first-links go?  And what does the first-link taxonomy of Wikipedia look like?

## [Satellite Image Classification on the fMoW Dataset](fmow.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">12/2017</p>

This post documents the use of CNNs for satellite image classification on The Functional Map of the World dataset. I look at fine-tuning, the effect of sample size distribution, and the effect of adding spatial context.

## [Discovering Class-Hierarchies by Clustering Confusion Matrices](cm-clustering.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">10/2017</p>

This is an example of how spectral clustering can be applied to a confusion matrix in order to find class hierarchies.

## [Solving Threes](bellman.md)

<p style="opacity:0.5">03/2016</p>

Threes is a dice game of endless fun.  Do you know how to play Threes?  Do you know how to win at Threes?  Here I explain the rules of Threes and use backward induction to find its optimal policy.

## [Artificial Life, Neural Nets, and Genetic Algorithms](neuroev.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">11/2015</p>

Can neural nets effectively control Artificial Life agents?  Can genetic algorithms optimize such neural nets?  In this post I implement a GA called Enforced Subpopulations to provide an example wherein GAs successfully optimize AL NNs.

## [Reinforcement Learning IRL](rl.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">12/2014</p>

This post describes an Arduino robot that learns to crawl using Q-learning.  Included is a video and tutorial showing the robot in action.
