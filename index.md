## [Quantum Mechanics Part 3: Joint Systems & Entanglement](quantum-3.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">11/2023</p>
Notes on how to model combined systems in quantum mechanics, based on Leonard Susskind's book _The Theoretical Minimum_.

## [Quantum Mechanics Part 2: Dynamics & Continuous States](quantum-2.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">07/2023</p>
Notes on the dynamics and representation of continuous states in quantum mechanics, based on Leonard Susskind's book _The Theoretical Minimum_.

## [Quantum Mechanics Part 1: States & Principles](quantum-1.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">06/2023</p>
Notes on the foundations of quantum mechanics, based on Leonard Susskind's book _The Theoretical Minimum_.

## [Classical Mechanics](classical-mechanics.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">05/2022</p>
Notes on classical mechanics from Leonard Susskind's book _The Theoretical Minimum_. The notes start with states and dynamics and then derives various formulations of CM, touching on symmetries, conservation laws and determinism.

## [TLDR: CNN Texture Bias](cnn-texture-bias.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">01/2021</p>
A summary of the paper _ImageNet-trained CNNs are biased toward texture; increasing shape bias increases accuracy and robustness_ by Geirhos et al, 2019.

## [PlatformIO Notes](platformio-notes.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">02/2020</p>
PlatformIO is an IDE for Arduino that supports environments and command-line uploads, but more importantly it has code completion and inspections, which the default Arduino IDE doesn't have.

## [The Hiring Problem](hiring-problem.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">09/2019</p>
Suppose you're interviewing candidates for a job. Interviews come at a cost, but they provide useful information about candidates. How many candidates should you interview before commiting to one?

## [Neural Style Transfer](neural-style-transfer.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">02/2019</p>
What defines the _style_ of an image? Can it be captured computationally? If so, is it possible to transfer styles from one image another, like making a selfie appear as if it were painted by Van Gogh? 

## [Kaggle Ship Detection Challenge](airbus.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">11/2018</p>
Ship detection in satellite images using a Kaggle dataset.

## [The First Link Taxonomy of Wikipedia](wikilinks.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">04/2018</p>
The first link on most Wikipedia pages goes to the next most general thing. For example, "poker" links to "card game", and "card game" links to "game", etc.  Where do all these first links lead? Does Wikipedia's have something like a first-link taxonomy?

## [Satellite Image Classification on the FMoW Dataset](fmow.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">12/2017</p>
Image classification on the Functional Map of the World dataset with a look at fine-tuning and the effects of sample size distribution and spatial context.

## [Discovering Class-Hierarchies by Clustering Confusion Matrices](cm-clustering.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">10/2017</p>
An example of how spectral clustering finds class hierarhies within confusion matrices.

## [Solving Threes](bellman.md)

<p style="opacity:0.5">03/2016</p>
A derivation of the optimal policy for the dice game _Threes_.

## [Artificial Life, Neural Nets, and Genetic Algorithms](neuroev.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">11/2015</p>
Can neural nets control Artificial Life agents?  Can genetic algorithms optimize these nets?  In this post I implement a genetic algorithm called Enforced Subpopulations to show that yes, yes they can.

## [Learning to Crawl: A Physical Implementation of Reinforcement Learning](rl.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">12/2014</p>
An Arduino robot learning to crawl using reinforcement learning, with a video about RL and how it's implemented in the robot.
