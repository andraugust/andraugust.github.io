## [Classical Mechanics](classical-mechanics.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">05/2022</p>
Notes on classical mechanics from Leonard Susskind's "Theoretical Minimum" book series.

## [TLDR: CNN Texture Bias](cnn-texture-bias.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">01/2021</p>
Notes on the paper _ImageNet-trained CNNs are biased toward texture; increasing shape bias increases accuracy and robustness_ by Geirhos et al, 2019.


## [PlatformIO Notes](platformio-notes.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">02/2020</p>
PlatformIO is a nice IDE for Arduino that supports environments and command-line uploads, but more importantly it has code completion and inspections, which the default Arduino IDE doesn't have.

## [The Hiring Problem](hiring-problem.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">09/2019</p>
Suppose you're interviewing candidates for a job. Interviews come at a cost, but they provide useful information about candidates. How many candidates should you interview to get the best one at minimum cost?

## [Neural Style Transfer](neural-style-transfer.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">02/2019</p>
What is the _style_ of an image? Is it something that can be encoded in a reasonable way? If so, would it be possible to transfer the style of one image onto another one, like making a selfie look like it was painted by Van Gogh? 

## [Kaggle Ship Detection Challenge](airbus.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">11/2018</p>
Automating the detection ships in satellite imagery using deep learning.

## [The First Link Taxonomy of Wikipedia](wikilinks.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">04/2018</p>
The first link on most Wikipedia pages goes to the next most general thing. For example, _poker_ links to _card game_, _card game_ links to _game_, _game_ links to _play_, etc.  What happens if you repeated click first-links? Where do you go? Is there any special stucture to Wikipedia's first-link taxonomy?

## [Satellite Image Classification on the FMoW Dataset](fmow.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">12/2017</p>
This post is about classification on the Functional Map of the World dataset. I look at fine-tuning and the effects of sample size distribution and spatial context.

## [Discovering Class-Hierarchies by Clustering Confusion Matrices](cm-clustering.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">10/2017</p>
This is an example of how spectral clustering can be applied to confusion matrices to find class hierarchies.

## [Solving Threes](bellman.md)

<p style="opacity:0.5">03/2016</p>
A derivation of the optimal policy for the dice game _Threes_.

## [Artificial Life, Neural Nets, and Genetic Algorithms](neuroev.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">11/2015</p>
Can neural nets successfully control Artificial Life agents?  Can genetic algorithms optimize such nets?  In this post I implement a genetic algorithm called Enforced Subpopulations to show that yes, yes they can.

## [Learning to Crawl: A Physical Implementation of Reinforcement Learning](rl.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">12/2014</p>
An Arduino robot learns to crawl using reinforcement learning. Included is a video about RL and how it was implemented in the robot.
