## [Neural Style Transfer](neural-style-transfer.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">02/2019</p>

Can style be transferred from one image to another?

## [Connecting PyCharm to a Remote Server](pycharm-remote.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">01/2019</p>

Reference for connecting PyCharm to a remote machine.

## [Kaggle Ship Detection Challenge](airbus.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">11/2018</p>

This is my dense ship segmenter for Kaggle's Ship Detection Challenge.  The pipeline consists of a ship/noship CNN followed by a ship segmenting Unet and some post-processing.

## [Exploring the First-Link Taxonomy of Wikipedia](wikilinks.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">04/2018</p>

An interesting property of Wikipedia is that pages often first-link to their immediate supersets.  For example, _poker_ first-links to _card game_ and _card game_ first-links to _game_, etc.  Where do all these first-links go?  And what does the first-link taxonomy of Wikipedia look like?

## [Satellite Image Classification on the fMoW Dataset](fmow.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">12/2017</p>

This post documents the use of CNNs for satellite image classification on The Functional Map of the World dataset. I look at fine-tuning, the effect of sample size distribution, and the effect of adding spatial context.

## [Discovering Class-Hierarchies by Clustering Confusion Matrices](cm-clustering.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">10/2017</p>

This is an example of how spectral clustering can be applied to a confusion matrix in order to find class hierarchies.

## [Solving Threes](bellman.md)

<p style="opacity:0.5">03/2016</p>

Threes is a dice game.  Do you know how to play Threes?  Do you know how to win at Threes?  Here I explain the rules of Threes and use backward induction to find its optimal policy.

## [Artificial Life, Neural Nets, and Genetic Algorithms](neuroev.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">11/2015</p>

Can neural nets successfully control Artificial Life agents?  Can genetic algorithms optimize these nets?  In this post I implement a GA called Enforced Subpopulations to give an example of a GA that successfully optimizes an AL NNs.

## [Reinforcement Learning IRL](rl.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">12/2014</p>

This post is about my Arduino robot that learns to crawl using Q-learning.  Included is a video and tutorial showing the robot in action.

## [Cheatsheet](cheatsheet.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">Ongoing</p>

Code snippets and such.
