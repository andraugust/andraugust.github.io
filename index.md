## [Quantum Mechanics Part 2: Particles and Dynamics](quantum-2.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">06/2023</p>
Notes on quantum mechanics from Leonard Susskind's "Theoretical Minimum" book series.

## [Quantum Mechanics Part 1: Systems, States and Principles](quantum-1.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">06/2023</p>
Notes on quantum mechanics from Leonard Susskind's "Theoretical Minimum" book series.

## [Classical Mechanics](classical-mechanics.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">05/2022</p>
Notes on classical mechanics from Leonard Susskind's "Theoretical Minimum" book series.

## [TLDR: CNN Texture Bias](cnn-texture-bias.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">01/2021</p>
Notes on the paper "ImageNet-trained CNNs are biased toward texture; increasing shape bias increases accuracy and robustness" by Geirhos et al, 2019.

## [PlatformIO Notes](platformio-notes.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">02/2020</p>
PlatformIO is a nice IDE for Arduino that supports environments and command-line uploads, but more importantly it has code completion and inspections, which the default Arduino IDE doesn't have.

## [The Hiring Problem](hiring-problem.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">09/2019</p>
Suppose you're interviewing candidates for a job. Interviews come at a cost, but they provide valueable information about candidates. How many candidates should you interview before commiting to one?

## [Neural Style Transfer](neural-style-transfer.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">02/2019</p>
What is the _style_ of an image? Is it something that can be encoded in a reasonable way? If so, would it be possible to transfer the style of one image onto another one, like making a selfie look like it was painted by Van Gogh? 

## [Kaggle Ship Detection Challenge](airbus.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">11/2018</p>
Automating the detection ships in satellite imagery using deep learning.

## [The First Link Taxonomy of Wikipedia](wikilinks.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">04/2018</p>
The first link on most Wikipedia pages goes to the next most general thing. For example, "poker" links to "card game", "card game" links to "game", "game" links to "play", etc.  What happens if you repeated click first-links? Where do you go? Is there any special stucture to Wikipedia's first-link taxonomy?

## [Satellite Image Classification on the FMoW Dataset](fmow.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">12/2017</p>
Classification on the Functional Map of the World dataset, a look at fine-tuning and the effects of sample size distribution and spatial context.

## [Discovering Class-Hierarchies by Clustering Confusion Matrices](cm-clustering.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">10/2017</p>
An example of how spectral clustering finds class hierarhies within confusion matrices.

## [Solving Threes](bellman.md)

<p style="opacity:0.5">03/2016</p>
A derivation of the optimal policy for the dice game _Threes_.

## [Artificial Life, Neural Nets, and Genetic Algorithms](neuroev.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">11/2015</p>
Can neural nets control Artificial Life agents?  Can genetic algorithms optimize these nets?  In this post I implement a genetic algorithm called Enforced Subpopulations to show that yes, yes they can.

## [Learning to Crawl: A Physical Implementation of Reinforcement Learning](rl.html)

<p style="opacity:0.5">12/2014</p>
An Arduino robot learning to crawl using reinforcement learning, with a video about RL and how it's implemented in the robot.
