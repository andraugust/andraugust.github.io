## 1. The Free Particle

Conceivably the simples particle to model is one with no forces acting on it. This is the so-called _free particle_. Without forces there is no potential, so the Hamiltonian is


$$
\mathbf{H} = \frac{\mathbf{P}^2}{2m} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}
$$


Plugging this into the GSE gives


$$
i\hbar\frac{\partial \psi(x,t)}{\partial t} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2 \psi(x,t)}{\partial x^2}
$$


This has the form of a diffusion equation with a complex coefficient, which, as we'll show, gives rise to wave-like solutions that spread out over time. 

To solve the PDE we use separation of variables. The result can be written several ways:


$$
\begin{align*}
\psi(x,t) &= \left(Ae^{ix\sqrt{2mE}/\hbar} + Be^{-ix\sqrt{2mE}/\hbar}\right) e^{-iEt/\hbar} \\
&= Ae^{i\left(k x - \omega t\right)} + Be^{-i\left(k x - \omega t\right)} \\
&= \left(A\cos\left(kx\right) + B\sin\left(kx\right)\right) e^{-i\omega t}
\end{align*}
$$


where $$A$$ and $$B$$ are constants chosen to fit the initial and/or boundary conditions of a specific configuration, and $$k = p/\hbar = \sqrt{2mE}/\hbar$$ and $$\omega = E/\hbar$$. 

By inspection, the solution consists of two identical planewaves moving in opposite directions. The waves' phase velocity is


$$
v = \omega/k = E/p = p/2m =\hbar k/2m
$$


Their dispersion relation is


$$
\omega (k) = \frac{\hbar k^2}{2m}
$$


In terms of normalization, the free particle wavefunction only normalizes when it's _bounded_. For example, if a particle is _un_-bounded such that it can exist freely in $$(-\infty,\infty)$$ or $$(0,\infty)$$ etc, then there's no way to set $$A$$ and $$B$$ such that $$\int\psi^*\psi = 1$$. Thus, to be physically meaningful free particles have to be bounded.

__Particle in a box.__ An example of a bounded free particle is the so-called particle in a box. Consider the potential


$$
V(0\le x \le L) = 0 \\
V(x < 0) = V(x>L) = \infty
$$


This is a "potential well" which bounds the particle between $$0$$ and $$L$$. The boundary conditions imply $$\psi(0)=\psi(L)=0$$, which, together with the normalization constraint, yields the solution


$$
\begin{align*}
\psi_n(x,t) &= \sqrt{\frac{2}{L}}\sin\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right) e^{-iE_nt/\hbar} \\
E_n &= \frac{\hbar^2 \pi^2}{2mL^2}n^2
\end{align*}
$$

where $$n\in \{0,1,2,...\}$$. 

The first few wavefunctions at $$t=0$$ are shown below on the left with their probability densities on the right. Interestingly, the boundary conditions force solutions to be countable and have discrete energy spectra.

Because the Schrodinger equation is linear, any linear combination of the $$\psi_n$$ is a solution, so the general solution is


$$
\sum_n a_n (0) \psi_n
$$


where $$a_n(0)$$ can be thought of as the "amount" of $$\psi_n$$ in the initial condition, subject to the constraint


$$
\sum_n a_n^*(0)a_n(0) = 1
$$


__Stationary states.__ Eigenfunctions of the Schrodinger equation are sometimes called _stationary states_. "Stationary" because their PDFs are time-independent. For example, if $$\psi_E(x)$$ is an eigenfunction of $$\mathbf{H}$$, then the wavefunction at time $$t$$ is


$$
\psi_E(x)e^{-iEt/\hbar}
$$


which depends on time, but the PDF doesn't. Note that the _sum_ of stationary states _isn't_ stationary. For example, if $$\psi_1$$ and $$\psi_2$$ are stationary and normalized individually, then the sum


$$
a\psi_1(x) e^{i\omega_1t} + b\psi_2(x) e^{i\omega_2t}
$$


has PDF


$$
\left| a\psi_1 \right|^2 + \left| b\psi_2 \right|^2 + a^*b\psi_1^*\psi_2\cos((\omega_1-\omega_2)t) + ab^*\psi_1\psi_2^*\sin((\omega_1-\omega_2)t)
$$

which is time-dependent. But keep in mind that if the energy of this system is measured, it returns just one of the energy eigenvalues $$E_1$$ or $$E_2$$ (corresponding to $$\omega_1$$ and $$\omega_2$$) and the wavefunction collapses to become stationary.

__Mutual Information.__ Looking at the PDFs for the particle in a box, it's evident that some position measurements provide more information about the system's energy than others. For example, if position is measured to be near $$L/2$$, then energy is unlikely to be an even level. The reason is that $$\psi_n^*\psi_n(L/2) \approx 0$$ when $$n$$ is even.

The reduction in uncertainty (or equivalently the gain in information) when energy or position is measured is calculated in terms of mutual information. Mutual information is
$$
\begin{align*}
I(X;E) &= H(X) + H(E) - H(X,E) \\
&= \sum_n \int_x P(x, E_n)\log\left( \frac{P(x,E_n)}{P(x)P(E_n)} \right)
\end{align*}
$$
Where $$X$$ and $$E$$ represent random variables for position and energy, and $$H$$ is entropy. This is the reduction in uncertainty averaged over all $$x$$, but as a function of $$x$$ it's simply
$$
I(X=x; E) = \sum_n P(x,E_n)\log\left( \frac{P(x,E_n)}{P(x)P(E_n)} \right)
$$
For the particle in a box, the wavefunction defines $$P(X=x)$$, and for $$P(E=E_n)$$ we can use the Boltzmann distribution:
$$
\begin{align*}
P(E_n) &\sim e^{-n^2} \\
P(x|E_n) &\sim \sin^2(n\pi x/L) \\
P(x) &= \sum_n P(x|E_n) P(E_n) \\
P(x,E_n) &= P(x|E_n)P(E_n)
\end{align*}
$$
The resulting calculation of mutual information isn't especially clean, but in principal these equations enable it to be carried out.

__The Gaussian Wavepacket.__  The _Gaussian wavepacket_ is a common wavefunction used to model unbound free particles. It's a wavefunction having Gaussian shape, so its density is Normal $$\psi^*\psi \sim N$$. This makes it ideal for modeling localized particles.

It may seem like this wavefunction isn't physical because unbound wavefunctions doesn't normalize:
$$
\begin{align*}
\psi(x,t) &= \psi_E(x)e^{-i\omega t} \\
&= (Ae^{ik x } + Be^{-ik x})e^{-i\omega t}
\end{align*}
$$
And this is trueâ€”if the particle has a single definite energy then the wavefunction doesn't normalize. But linear combinations of such solutions, when weighted appropriately for many energies _can_ normalize, and this is the way in which unbound free particles are modeled.

How does this work? Consider the general solution of the SE derived earlier for discrete vectors:
$$
\ket{\Psi(t)} = \sum_i \bk{E_i}{\Psi(0)} e^{-i E_i t/\hbar} \ket{E_i}
$$
The continuous version is
$$
\psi(x,t) = \int \left( \int \psi_E^*(x) \psi(x,0) \,dx \right) e^{-iEt/\hbar} \psi_E(x) \, dE
$$
Where $$\psi(x,0)$$ is an arbitrary intial condition and the integrals run from $$-\infty$$ to $$+\infty$$. Normally,
$$
\psi_E(x) = Ae^{ik x } + Be^{-ik x}
$$
but because the integral covers negative and positive values of $$x$$ we can drop one of the terms. We'll drop the second term to get
$$
\begin{align*}
\psi(x,t) &= \int \left( \int e^{-ipx/\hbar} \psi(x,0) \,dx \right) e^{-iEt/\hbar} e^{ipx/\hbar} \, dp \\
&= \int \left(\mathbf{F}\psi(x,0)\right) e^{i(kx-\omega t)} dk \\
&=\int \bar\psi(k,0)e^{i(kx-\omega t)}dk
\end{align*}
$$
So the general solution is a sum of planewaves weighted by the "amount" of each wave present in the initial condition.

Consider the following initial condition in momentum-space:

$$
\bar\psi(p,0) = \frac{1}{(2\pi \sigma_p^2)^{1/4}} \exp (-\frac{(p-p_0)^2}{4\sigma_p^2})
$$


When squared this wavepacket is a Gaussian centered around $$p_0$$ with spread $$\sigma_p$$. In position space the corresponding wavefunction is


$$
\psi(x,0) = \left( \frac{4 \sigma_p^2 \hbar^2}{2\pi} \right)^{1/4} \exp(-\sigma_p^2 x^2 /\hbar^2) \exp(ip_0x/\hbar)
$$


Which is a Gaussian function multiplied by a wave factor. By inspection, position space uncertainty is related to momentum space uncertainty by $$\sigma_x \sigma_p = \hbar/2$$, which is exactly the lower limit of the Heisenberg uncertainty relation. Note that plugging $$\psi(x,0)$$ into the SE we find that it's _not_ a solution.

Plugging $$\bar \psi(p,0)$$ into the GSE solution and taking the integral gives


$$
\psi(x,t) = \frac{(2\pi\sigma_x^2)^{-1/4}}{\left(1+i\frac{\hbar}{2m\sigma_x^2}\right)^{1/2}}\exp \frac{-x^2+\frac{i}{\hbar}(4\sigma_x p_0 x + 2\sigma_x^2p_0^2t)}{4\sigma_x^2(1+i\frac{\hbar}{2m\sigma_x^2}t)}
$$


This is a complicated looking wavefunction, but its density is a Gaussian:


$$
\lvert \psi(x,t) \rvert^2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma_x^2(t)}} \exp -\frac{\left( x-\mu(t) \right)^2}{2\sigma^2_x(t)}
$$


Where


$$
\begin{align*}
\mu(t) &= \frac{p_0}{m}t \\
\sigma_x(t) &= \sigma_x \sqrt{1+\left(\frac{\hbar}{2m\sigma_x^2}t\right)^2}
\end{align*}
$$


So the center of the wavepacket moves with "group velocity" $$p_0/m$$ just like a classical particle, and the dispersion of the phase waves causes the packet to spread over time. The spread increases like $$\sqrt{1+t^2}$$, so the particle becomes less localized and the product $$\sigma_x\sigma_p$$ rises above the Heisenberg lower limit.

What happens when a Gaussian wavepacket is measured? If its energy is measured to be, say, $$E_0$$ then the wavefunction collapses to the eigenfunction corresponding to that energy, namely $$\exp(ix\sqrt{2mE_0}/\hbar)$$.

## 2. Harmonic Oscillator

The quantum harmonic oscillator is modeled with a quadratic potential like the classical harmonic oscillator is. The Hamiltonian becomes


$$
\mathbf{H} = \frac{\mathbf{P}^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2\mathbf{X}^2 = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2x^2
$$


where $$\omega$$ is the oscillator's frequency parameter. Plugging this into the GSE gives


$$
i\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = -\frac{\hbar}{2m} \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial x^2} + \frac{m \omega^2}{2\hbar}x^2\psi
$$


This PDE can be simplified by recalling that the solution is the sum of energy eigenvectors multiplied by the time-dependant factor $$\exp(-iE_it/\hbar)$$. So the first step is finding the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of 


$$
\mathbf{H}\psi_E = E\psi_E
$$


where $$\psi_E$$ is an energy eigenvector corresponding to the energy eigenvalue $$E$$. The ODE this produces is


$$
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2 \psi_E}{d x^2} + \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 x^2 \psi_E = E\psi_E
$$


It turns out that this equation has solutions for every value of $$E$$ (including complex $$E$$) but only a small few of them normalize, the rest diverge and therefore don't represent physically meaningful states. The ones that converge _do_ represent physical states, and these are the states we're looking for.

Deriving the normalizable states requires quite a bit of technical math that isn't especially relevant to the physics, so I'll just present the results: for each $$0 \le n$$ the $$n$$th energy eigenvalue is


$$
E_n = \left( n + \frac{1}{2} \right)\hbar\omega
$$


and the corresponding wavefunction is


$$
\psi_n(x) = \sqrt{\frac{a}{2^n n! \sqrt{\pi}}} H_n(ax) e^{-a^2x^2/2}
$$


where $$a = \sqrt{\omega m / \hbar}$$ and $$H_n$$ are _Hermite polynomials_. The probability densities of the first few energies are shown below along with the potential energy function.

There are a few interesting things to noticeâ€¦

* The minimum energy is not zeroâ€”it's $$\hbar \omega /2$$. So for an oscillator to exist at all some energy is required. This can be understood in terms of the uncertainty principle: suppose we try to make the total energy zero by closely localizing the particle to $$x=0$$. In this case the potential energy will be approximately zero, but the momentum will be very spread out, and momentum has energy associated with it. On the other hand if we try to set the particle at rest so it has no momentum then the position will be spread out, in particular it will be spread out away from $$x=0$$ and therefore have potential energy. So either way the oscillator has _some_ energy.
* The energy levels don't depend on mass (in constrast to particle in a box). 
* Hermite polynomials are orthogonal (they better beâ€”they're eigenvectors!).
* The probability density is non-zero outside the potential energy curve, so the particle can be found _beyond_ the classically allowed region.
* Inside the classical region there are points where the density is zero, so the particle will _never_ be measured there even though it can be classically.
* In the limit of large $$n$$ the quantum density approaches the classical density.
