### What are they?

- Induced Demand: Induced Demand is latent demand applied to traffic. In particular, it's when adding roads to a transportation network doesn't proportionally reduce traffic, instead it 'releases' unanticipated demand for transportation, thereby reducing the expected reduction in traffic. The unanticipated demand is usually called _latent demand_.
