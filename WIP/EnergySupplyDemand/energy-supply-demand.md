## Energy Demand

- How much energy do people demand? (footnote on consumption vs demand - demand is W; consumption is total J. Utility companies charge more when demand is high)
  - What are the right units to work with?
  - How to measure demand across sources, e.g., chemical, electric, etc?
  - How does demand vary by demander?
- How does demand vary by region?
  - What are the factors of variation?
- How has demand varied over time?
  - What are the factors of variation?
    - Population growth
- Extrapolating into the future: How much energy demand will there be in 10-50 years?

## Energy Supply

### Wind

### Water

### Solar

## Supply & Demand

Supply and demand aren't independent, but for simplicitiy and introduction we've treated them as such so far.  Now let's look at how they interact.

- Will demand reach a steady state? Or will it inflate to fill supply?
- Where do different demanders get their energy?  e.g., where does a person living in eastern washington get their enegy vs. where does an airport in Chicago get its energy?





## Human Energy Sinks



## Climate Dynamics



## Human Population Dynamics



### Things to note somewhere

- We don't actually use energy; we use entropy.
