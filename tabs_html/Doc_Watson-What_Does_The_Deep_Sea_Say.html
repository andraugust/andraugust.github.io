<br><br><br>INTRO<br><br>She stood on the beach alone<br>And gaze at the misty blue<br>Deep sea, as you hold him to your breast<br>Does he mention my name to you?<br><br>Oh, where is my sailor boy?<br>Where is my sailor boy?<br>He sleeps at the bottom of the deep blue sea<br>And he can't come back to me<br><br>Oh, what does the deep sea say?<br>What does the deep sea say?<br>It moans it groans it splashes and it foams<br>And it rolls on its weary way<br><br>FIDDLE<br><br>Oh, please tell me, deep blue sea<br>Is he sleeping peacefully?<br>The winds from the north are blowin' icy cold<br>Can you keep him warm for me?<br><br>If only my grieving soul<br>Some token of love could find<br>If only the waves would show me where he sleeps<br>Then I'd leave this world behind<br><br>CHORUS<br><br>MANDO & BANJO<br><br>A beautiful rose one day<br>I placed on the crest of a wave<br>I said "Take it please and let it settle home<br>Above his watery grave"<br><br>The driftwood I watched in vain<br>And my rose never came back again<br>Oh, waves, take another message to my love<br>Sayin' I'll meet him above<br><br>Oh, what does the deep sea say?<br>What does the deep sea say?<br>It goards and keeps my lover where he sleeps<br>And it rolls on its weary way<br><br><br><br><br>
