## 1. Dynamics

In classical mechanics states are represented by points in phase space that change under the influence of forces. In quantum mechanics states are complex vectors in Hilbert space. How and what causes them to change is the subject of this second post on QM.

__Time Evolution Operator.__ Dynamics for vectors, including those in Hilbert space, can generically be modeled as


$$
\ket{\Psi(t_2)}=\mathbf{U}(t_2,t_1) \ket{\Psi(t_1)}
$$

where $$\mathbf{U}$$ is a "time evolution operator" that maps states from one time to another. Usually we set $$t_1=0$$ and $$t_2=t$$ and simply write $$\mathbf{U}(t,0) \rightarrow \mathbf{U}(t)$$. 

At this point $$\mathbf{U}$$ could be anything, but there's one thing we want $$\mathbf{U}$$ to do, and that's conserve inner products. Susskind calls this "conservation of information" and it implies that for arbitrary $$t$$ it be true that $$\bk{\Psi(t)}{\Phi(t)} = \bk{\Psi(0)}{\Phi(0)}$$ or

$$
\bra{\Psi(0)}\mathbf{U}(t)^{\dagger}\mathbf{U}(t)\ket{\Phi(0)} = \bk{\Psi(0)}{\Phi(0)}
$$


So $$\mathbf{U}^{\dagger}\mathbf{U} = I$$ and therefore $$\mathbf{U}$$ is unitary. A corollary is that the magnitude of state vectors is conserved through time.

These results are for finite evolutions. What about infinitesimal ones? In the limit, the linear infinitesimal approximation of $$\mathbf{U}$$ is

$$
\mathbf{U}(\epsilon) = I - \epsilon i \mathbf{H}
$$


Where $$\epsilon$$ is a very small time interval, $$\mathbf{H}$$ is a constant operator, and $$-i$$ is included so the results fit experiments. What does this operator do to $$\ket{\Psi}$$?


$$
\begin{align*}
\ket{\Psi(\epsilon)} &= \mathbf{U}(\epsilon) \ket{\Psi(0)} \\
\ket{\Psi(\epsilon)} &= (I - \epsilon i \mathbf{H}) \ket{\Psi(0)} \\
\frac{\ket{\Psi(\epsilon)} - \ket{\Psi(0)}}{\epsilon} &= -i\mathbf{H} \ket{\Psi(0)} \\
\end{align*}
$$


As $$\epsilon \rightarrow 0$$,


$$
\frac{\partial \ket{\Psi}}{\partial t} = -\frac{i}{\hbar}\mathbf{H}\ket{\Psi}
$$


where $$\hbar$$ is included to make units work, it's value is about $$10^{-34} kg \space m^2/s$$. This PDE is called the _generalized Schrodinger equation_.

Before moving on to solve the GSE, we can learn a bit about $$\mathbf{H}$$ by asking what, if anything, the unitary condition on $$\mathbf{U}$$ implies about it:


$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{U}(\epsilon)^\dagger \mathbf{U}(\epsilon) &= (I - \epsilon i \mathbf{H})^\dagger (I - \epsilon i \mathbf{H}) \\
&= (I + \epsilon i \mathbf{H}^\dagger) (I - \epsilon i \mathbf{H}) \\
&= I - \epsilon i \mathbf{H} + \epsilon i \mathbf{H}^\dagger = I \\
\end{align*}
$$


So $$\mathbf{U}$$ being unitary implies $$\mathbf{H}$$ is Hermitian and therefore can represents an observable, which, as we'll see, is the quantum Hamiltonian.

In CM recall that Hamiltonians represent the total energy of a system and relate to the system's dynamics through the Poisson bracket:


$$
\dot{L}=\{L,H\}
$$


$$L$$ here is any quantity defined over phase space $$L(q,p)$$. Using the GSE it's straightforward to show that a similar relation exists in QM but for expected values:


$$
\frac{d}{dt}\left<\mathbf{L}\right> = -\frac{i}{\hbar}\left<\left[\mathbf{L},\mathbf{H}\right]\right>
$$


$$\left[\mathbf{L},\mathbf{H}\right] = \mathbf{L}\mathbf{H} - \mathbf{H}\mathbf{L}$$ is called the commutator. From it we see that if a quantity commutes with $$\mathbf{H}$$ then it's conserved (in expectation), and more generally any function of a quantity that commutes with $$\mathbf{H}$$ is conserved (in expectation). This is like in CM where if the PB is $$0$$ then $$L$$ is conserved.

Note that in QM expected values don't change due to the measurables changing. Those are fixed for a given operator (for example $$\pm 1$$ for spin). Instead, expected values change because the measureables' associated _probabilities_ change, and to calculate how they change we have to solve the generalized Schrodinger equation.

__Solving the GSE.__ Solving the GSE is easiest in the energy basis where $$\mathbf{H}$$ is diagonal and an arbitrary state vector can be written as


$$
\ket{\Psi(t)} = \sum_i a_i(t) \ket{E_i}
$$


$$\ket{E_i}$$ is an energy eigenvector satisfying $$\mathbf{H}\ket{E_i} = E_i\ket{E_i}$$. Inserting this into the GSE gives


$$
\begin{align*}
\sum_i \dot{a}_i(t) \ket{E_i} &= -\frac{i}{\hbar} \mathbf{H} \sum_i a_i(t) \ket{E_i} \\
&= -\frac{i}{\hbar} \sum_i E_i a_i(t) \ket{E_i}\\
\end{align*}
$$


Which is a simple first-order ODE for each component. The solution is


$$
a_i(t) = a_i(0) e^{-iE_it/\hbar}
$$


Compared to the general form of an oscillator $$\exp(-i \omega t)$$ we see that $$E/\hbar$$ plays the role of frequency in QM.

This solution assumes we're working in the energy basis. What if we're given a state vector in a different basis and want to compute dynamics? Given a general state vector $$\ket{\Psi}$$ in a non-energy basis (such as the spin basis $$\ket{+z}$$, $$\ket{-z}$$), factor the Hamiltonian according to $$\mathbf{H} = \mathbf{P}\mathbf{\Lambda}\mathbf{P}^{\dagger}$$, then the state in the energy basis is $$\mathbf{P}^{\dagger}\ket{\Psi}$$.  In terms of components $$a_i = \bk{E_i}{\Psi}$$, where $$a_i$$ is the $$i$$th component of $$\ket{\Psi}$$ in the energy basis. This is all summarized by the general solution to the SE:


$$
\ket{\Psi(t)} = \sum_i \bk{E_i}{\Psi(0)} e^{-iE_it/\hbar} \ket{E_i}
$$

## 2. Continuous States

So far the states we've looked at are finite in the sense that they can be written as a finite sum over basis vectors. Eventually we'd like to model measureables that have continuous eigenvalues, such as position and momentum. How are such infinite-dimensional states modeled? 

The answer is that they're modeled in the same way that finite states are modeled: by the principles of QM. The trick is to keep in mind that the principles don't require states to be finiteâ€”they only define conditions and physical interpretations related to _vectors_, and vectors can be anything, finite or infinite, as long as they satisfy the mathematical axioms of vectors (they commute, have an inverse, etc). Complex functions in this sense are infinite-dimensional vectors and they're exactly what are used to model continuous states.

__Wave Functions.__ In terms of notation, a continuous state is associated with a _wave function_ $$\psi(x)$$ which takes a complex input and returns a complex output. Wave functions are defined with respect to a basis just as discrete vectors are, and their form can change from one basis to another, just as discrete vectors can. The bra-ket notation is useful for wave-functions as it is for discrete vectors. The discrete representation


$$
\ket{A} = \sum_i a_i \ket{i}
$$


becomes


$$
\ket{\Psi} = \int \psi(x) \ket{x} \,dx
$$


where $$x$$ labels eigenvalues and $$\ket{x}$$ is the associated eigenvector. In this analogy, $$\psi(x)$$ is like a continuous set of coefficients. Another way to think of wave functions is in terms of them being a state vector's projection onto a basis. For example, in the $$x$$ basis the wave function is


$$
\psi(x) = \bk{x}{\Psi}
$$


__Continuous Operators.__ Operators on continuous vectors are similar to operators on discrete vectors: they're linear and Hermitian. To verify linearity you check that they distribute over the sum of functions with constants factoring out. In other words,


$$
\mathbf{L}(a\psi(x)+b\phi(x)) = a\mathbf{L}\psi(x) + b\mathbf{L}\phi(x)
$$


Examples of linear operators include multiplication by $$x$$ and differentiation by $$d/dx$$.

Hermiticity is a bit trickier to verify. It occurs when


$$
\bke{\psi}{\mathbf{L}}{\phi} = \bke{\phi}{\mathbf{L}}{\psi}^{*}
$$


Where


$$
\bke{\psi}{\mathbf{L}}{\phi} = \int \psi^*(x)\mathbf{L} \phi(x) \,dx
$$


For example, if $$\mathbf{L}=x$$ this is


$$
\begin{align*}
\bke{\psi}{x}{\phi} &= \int \psi^*(x) x \phi(x) \,dx \\
&= \left( \int \psi(x) x \phi^*(x) \,dx \right)^* \\
&= \bke{\phi}{x}{\psi}^*
\end{align*}
$$


Therefore the operator $$x$$ is Hermitian. Note that the $$\dagger$$ from discrete operators gets replaced by $$*$$ for functions because there are no transposes for functions. Applying the same test to $$d/dx$$ we find that it's not Hermitian, but if we multiply it by $$i$$ it is.

__Eigenfunctions of Position.__ How are eigenvalues and eigenvectors computed for continuous operators? For position the operator is $$x$$ and its eigenvalues are denoted by $$x_0$$. The eigenequation is


$$
x\psi(x) = x_0 \psi(x)
$$


or


$$
(x-x_0)\psi(x) = 0
$$


If $$x \ne x_0$$ then this requires $$\psi(x) = 0$$, and when $$x = x_0$$ then $$\psi(x)$$ can be anything, but because $$\psi$$ is a probability amplitude, it must integrate to $$1$$, so the eigenfunction is


$$
\psi(x) = \delta(x-x_0)
$$


This states the obvious fact that if a particle is measured at $$x_0$$ then it's only at $$x_0$$. It's important to note that $$\delta$$ is not a function, it's a distribution, and as such belongs inside an integral as


$$
\begin{align*}
\ket{\Psi} &= \int \psi(x) \ket{x} \,dx \\
&= \int \delta(x-x_0) \ket{x} dx \\
&= \ket{x_0}
\end{align*}
$$


__Eigenfunctions of Momentum.__ What are the eigenfunctions of momentum? For momentum the set-up and solution are the same, but now $$\bar\psi$$ is used to denote a wave function in momentum space:


$$
p\bar\psi(p) = p_0\bar\psi(p) \\
\rightarrow \bar\psi(p) = \delta(p-p_0)
$$


The $$\delta$$ function solution here and for position are not especially insightful, but when we look at momentum in the $$x$$ basis things are more interesting. In the $$x$$ basis, from experimental insight, the momentum operator changes from $$p$$ to $$-i\hbar \, d/dx$$. The eigenequation becomes


$$
-i\hbar \frac{d}{dx}\psi(x) = p \psi(x)
$$


and the solution is


$$
\psi(x) = Ae^{ipx/\hbar}
$$


Note that because this is a wavefunction in the $$x$$-basis it's considered a function of $$x$$ and not $$p$$. The $$p$$ appears because each value of momentum has a different wavefunction associated with it, so $$p$$ acts more like a parameter or index.

The constant $$A$$ is determined by normalization:


$$
\bk{\psi}{\psi} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \psi(x)^*\psi(x) \,dx = 1
$$


But this gives


$$
|A|^2\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \,dx = 1
$$


Which is undefined. This reflects the fact that when particles are unconstrained in space the planewave solution $$\exp(ipx/\hbar)$$ is physically unrealistic. In practice, particles are either constrained in space such that the integration limits are finite, or, if they are un-constrained in space, they're acted on by a potential such that the wave-function goes to zero sufficiently quickly for the integral to converge.

__Changing Basis.__ Generally speaking, a state vector $$\ket{\Psi}$$ can be represented in any basis. For example, in the $$x$$ basis $$\psi(x) = \bk{x}{\Psi}$$, in the momentum basis $$\bar\psi(p) = \bk{p}{\Psi}$$, etc. Because these representations ultimately correspond to the same state, namely $$\ket{\Psi}$$, there must be a way to transform between them. How do we transform between the $$x$$ and $$p$$ basis? 

The trick is to use the identity operator:

$$
I = \int \ket{x}\bra{x} \cdot \,dx
$$


Where "$$\cdot$$" is a placeholder for the vector which the operator acts on. Inserting this into the momentum-representation gives


$$
\begin{align*}
\bar\psi(p) &= \bk{p}{\Psi} \\
&= \bke{p}{I}{\Psi} \\
&= \int \bk{p}{x}\bk{x}{\Psi}\,dx \\
\end{align*}
$$


But


$$
\begin{align*}
\bk{p}{x} &= \int A e^{-ipx'/\hbar} \delta(x'-x) \,dx' \\
&= Ae^{-ipx/\hbar}
\end{align*}
$$


And $$\bk{x}{\Psi} = \psi(x)$$, so


$$
\bar\psi(p) = A\int e^{-ipx/\hbar} \psi(x) \, dx
$$


Which is the formula for converting a position-space wave function into its momentum-space complement. The derivation of the inverse operation is similar. The result is


$$
\psi(x) = A \int e^{ipx/\hbar} \bar\psi(p) \,dp
$$


So position and momentum space are related by the Fourier transform. This leads to the interpretation that momentum space is the spatial frequency domain of position space, where spatial frequency is given by $$k=p/\hbar$$.

__Changing Basis: Operators.__ How do operators change basis? Operators change basis like matrices do: $$\mathbf{L' = \mathbf{U} \mathbf{L} \mathbf{U}^{-1}}$$, where $$\mathbf{L}$$ is the operator of interest, $$\mathbf{L}'$$ is the transformed operator, and $$\mathbf{U}$$ is a unitary change-of-basis operator. Because $$\mathbf{U}$$ is unitary and we're working with continuous operators we can set $$\mathbf{U}^{-1} = \mathbf{U}^*$$.

How does this work for position and momentum? The relevant change-of-basis operator is the Fourier transform $$\mathbf{F}$$. Is it unitary? Yes, because $$\mathbf{F}^*\mathbf{F}\psi(x) = \psi(x)$$, which implies that $$\mathbf{F}^*\mathbf{F}=I$$. Let's use $$\mathbf{F}$$ to derive the position operator in momentum space, call it $$\mathbf{\bar X}$$.


$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{\bar X} \bar\psi(p) &= \mathbf{F}\mathbf{X}\mathbf{F}^* \bar \psi(p) \\
&= \mathbf{F} \mathbf{X} \psi(x) \\
&= \mathbf{F} x \psi(x) \\
&= i\hbar \frac{d}{dp} \bar \psi(p)
\end{align*}
$$


Where the last step comes from a Fourier transform identity. So the position operator in momentum-space has a similar form to the momentum operator in position space, namely $$i\hbar d/dp$$.

Another way to determine or verify an operator in a new basis is through the use of commutators. The reason is that commutators are _basis independent_. For example, $$[\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{P}] = [\mathbf{\bar X}, \mathbf{\bar P}] = i\hbar$$. This method may require some guessing and checking, whereas the unitary method above is an explicit calculation that should always give the correct result, though it may be more challenging to acquire mathematically.

As a practical note, when working with operators it's helpful to supply them with a test function to act on, otherwise it isn't always clear exactly how they simplify.

__Position-Momentum Uncertainty.__ Going back to the discussion of commutators, we found that two observables are simultaneously knowable iff their operators commute. Do the operators for $$x$$ and $$p$$ commute? The answer is no. Given $$\mathbf{X}=x$$ and $$\mathbf{P}=-i\hbar d/dx $$ the commutator is


$$
[\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{P}] = i\hbar
$$


Which means position and momentum aren't simultaneously knowableâ€”measuring one destroys information about the other, and vice versa. They are said to be _incompatible_. Just how unknowable are they together? Defining unknowability in terms of the standard deviation $$\sigma$$ of an operator we find (from the general uncertainty principle) that


$$
\sigma_x \sigma_p \ge \frac{\hbar}{2}
$$

The lower limit on simultaneous uncertainty is reached when either $$\psi$$ or $$\bar \psi$$ are Gaussian function, as is shown later in the section on wavepackets.

__What happened to y and z?__ For the sake of simplicity I've focused this post on measurements in one dimension, namely $$x$$, but generalizing to $$y$$ and $$z$$ is straighforward. The position operator for $$y$$ is $$y$$ and the momentum operator for $$y$$ is $$-i\hbar\, \partial/\partial y$$. Same goes for $$z$$. Note the change from total derivatives to partials.

Are measurements compatible across dimensions? The answer is yes. Using $$i$$ and $$j$$ to index spatial dimensions we get


$$
\begin{align*}
[\mathbf{X}_i, \mathbf{X}_j] &= 0 \\
[\mathbf{P}_i, \mathbf{P}_j] &= 0 \\
[\mathbf{X}_i, \mathbf{P}_j] &= i\hbar \delta_{ij} \\
\end{align*}
$$

__The Classical Connection.__ In CM momentum is mass times velocity, while in QM it's represented by a differentiation operator.  How are these two connected, and is there a general way to connect CM to QM? 

The classical-quantum connection is made through expected values. For example, in QM the classical notion of velocity corresponds to 

$$
v \leftrightarrow \frac{d}{dt} \left< \mathbf{X} \right>
$$


To see why this is true, start by looking at the time-derivative in terms of the Hamiltonian commutator:


$$
\frac{d}{dt}\left<\mathbf{X}\right> = -\frac{i}{\hbar}\left<\left[\mathbf{X},\mathbf{H}\right]\right>
$$


In the absence of a potential the right side simplifies to $$\left< \mathbf{P} \right>/m$$, which is the classical result for velocity.

What about when a potential _is_ present? In CM the dynamics are


$$
\frac{dp}{dt} = -\frac{dV}{dx}
$$


In QM the left side becomes


$$
\frac{d}{dt}\left<\mathbf{P}\right> = -\frac{i}{\hbar}\left<[\mathbf{P},\mathbf{H}]\right>
$$


The Hamiltonian is


$$
\mathbf{H} = \frac{\mathbf{P}^2}{2m} + \mathbf{V}(x)
$$


Which leads to


$$
\frac{d}{dt}\left<\mathbf{P}\right> = -\left<\frac{d\mathbf{V}}{dx}\right>
$$


So the quantum result matches the classical result in expectation, but note that on the right side the expectation is taken with respect to the entire derivative, which in general is different from taking it over $$x$$ and then differentiating. In other words,


$$
\left<\frac{d\mathbf{V}}{dx}\right> \neq \frac{d\mathbf{V}(\left<x\right>)}{d\left<x\right>}
$$

Susskind points out that 

## Last

This concludes the summary of dynamics & continuous states in quantum mechanics. The framework has been laid to model realistic systems, such as free particles, spatially constrained particles, harmonic oscillators, and hydrogen atoms, all of which are covered in the next section. To be continuedâ€¦
