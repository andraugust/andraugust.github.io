A                                   E                 A
I got high and I got in jail, I got high and I got in jail
      D                              A
I got high and I got in jail, had no one for to go my bail
A                 E          A
My sins they have over taken me


Hand me down my walking cane
I'm gonna leave on a morning train

The beans was tough and the meat was fat
Oh good golly I couldn't eat that

Come on Mom and go my bail
Get me out of this Nashville jail

If I die in Tennessee
Ship me back my COV

Hand me down my bottle of corn
Gonna get drunk as sure as you're born

Hand me down my walking cane
I'm gonna leave on a morning train
