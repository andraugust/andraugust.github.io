Jim Croce - Mama Tried

Cappo 1

A                      D             A                D
First thing I remember knowin' was a lonesome whistle blowin'
      A                   D             E7
And a young-on's dream of growing up to ride
     A                     D         A                 D
On a freight train leaving town, not knowing where I'm bound
       A                   E             A
And no one could change my mind, but Mama tried

One and only rebel child, from a family meek and mild
Mama seemed to know what lay in store
'Spite of all my Sunday learnin', toward the bad I kept on turnin'
'Til Mama couldn't hold me anymore

CHORUS:
A                                       G        D      A
And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole
   A                  A               E        
No one could change my mind, but Mama tried, Mama tried
     A                                 G        D  A
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading I denied,
                       E                 A
that leaves only me to blame, 'cause Mama tried

Dear old Daddy rest his soul, he left my mom a heavy load
She tried so very hard to fill his shoes
Working hours without rest, she wanted me to have the best
She tried to raise me right, but I refused

CHORUS
