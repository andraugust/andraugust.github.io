[VERSE]
Well, I barfed on my dress
Now I'm barfing in the bathroom
She sighs as she holds back my hair
You're a boy in a man-suit
How on earth do I love you?
And how can I leave you like this?

[CHORUS]
Lord, give an elbow to my heart
Sounds strange, but I need one tonight
So it don't break on the corners of this rigid love
I'm too fuckin' wasted to fight

[VERSE]
She puts a kiss on my forehead
And walks over to the doorway
I sigh, she's seen my true face
I'm no lover, I'm no artist
Just a drunk-man in a sundress
On the floor, in a toilet's embrace

[CHORUS]
Lord, give an elbow to my heart
Sounds strange, but I need one tonight
So it don't break on the corners of this rigid love
I'm too fuckin' wasted to fight
