[Verse 1]

D               G
I don't care if Monday's blue
D                  A
Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too
Bm             G
Thursday I don't care about you
     D             A
It's Friday I'm in love


[Verse 2]

Monday you can fall apart
Tuesday Wednesday break my heart
Thursday doesn't even start
It's Friday I'm in love


[Chorus]

G        A
Saturday wait
Bm              G
And Sunday always comes too late
    D            A
But Friday never hesitate...


[Verse 3]

I don't care if Mondays black
Tuesday Wednesday heart attack
Thursday never looking back
It's Friday I'm in love


[Break]

D  G  D  A  Bm  G  D  A


[Verse 4]

Monday you can hold your head
Tuesday Wednesday stay in bed
Or Thursday watch the walls instead
It's Friday I'm in love


[Chorus]

Saturday wait
And Sunday always comes too late
But Friday never hesitate...


[Bridge]

Bm                C                         D
Dressed up to the eyes, it's a wonderful surprise
            A                       Bm
To see your shoes and your spirits rise
                   C                             D
Throwing out your frown and just smiling at the sound
                   A
And as sleek as a shriek spinning round and round
Bm                C                           D
Always take a big bite, it's such a gorgeous sight
         A                          Bm
To see you eat in the middle of the night
                    C                    D
You can never get enough, enough of this stuff
           A
It's Friday I'm in love


[Repeat Verse 1]

I don't care if Monday's blue
Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too
Thursday I don't care about you
It's Friday I'm in love


[Repeat Verse 2]

Monday you can fall apart
Tuesday Wednesday break my heart
Thursday doesn't even start
It's Friday I'm in love


[Outro]

D  G  D  A  Bm  G  D  A  x2
