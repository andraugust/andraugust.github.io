
G                 WALK
Merry run around 
G                MOVE
Sailin' up and down 
G                            C
Looking for a shot in some direction. 
 
Got it from the top 
It's nothing you can stop 
Lord, you know they made a fire connection 
               G
They love each other. 

[CHORUS]
F        C       G
Lord you can see that it's true 
Lord you can see that it's true 
Lord you can see that it's true 
 
He could pass his time 
Around some other line 
But you know he choose this place beside her 
They love each other 
 
CHORUS
 
Don't get in their way 
There's nothing you can say 
Nothing that you need to add or do 
They love each other 
 
CHORUS 
 
Its' nothing, they explain 
It's like a diesel train 
You better not be there when it rolls over 
They love each other 
 
CHORUS 
 
Though you're making noise 
Just can't hear your voice 
What a dizzy ride and you're cold sober 
They love each other 
 
CHORUS 
 
Bridge: 
Hoping you believe me 
What I say is true 
Everything I'm tellin' 
I heard it first from you. 
 
Heard your news report 
You know you're falling short 
Pretty soon won't trust you for the weather 

When that ship comes in 
You won't know where it's been 
You gotta try and see a little further 
They love each other 
 
CHORUS
