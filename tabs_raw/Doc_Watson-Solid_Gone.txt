Sometimes I'm happy, sometimes I'm blue

But today I'm so lonesome I don't know what to do

My blue-eyed baby she's solid gone

Oh I love that woman but she's gone

I know I'm gonna miss her 'cause she's gone

She's solid gone


Listen to that train rollin' down the track

It's taking her away and it 'aint a-comin' back

She's gone she's solid gone

F-C SOLO


When my baby left me she even took my shoes

And that's enough to give a man those dog-gone blues

Oh yes she's gone she's solid gone

Oh I love that woman but she's gone

I know I'm gonna miss her 'cause she's gone

She's solid gone


FULL SOLO



Would you listen to that engine pulling around the curve

She's whistling and blowing straining every nerve

And now she's gone she's solid gone
