Capo 2 (optional)

INTRO
I V I IV I

[VERSE]
C                            F
I almost felt you touchin' me just now 
C                          G
I wish I knew which way to turn and go 
C                     F
I feel so good then I feel so bad 
G                    C  F C
Wonder what I oughta do 

[CHORUS]
           F
If I could only fly 
           C
If I could only fly 
             G
I'd bid this place goodbye 
                    C
To come and be with you 
          F
But I can hardly stand 
      C
Got nowhere to run 
        G
Another sinkin' sun 
                C    F    C
One more lonely night 

[VERSE]
The wind keeps blowin' somewhere every day
They tell me things get better somewhere up the way 
Just dismal thinkin' on a dismal day 
Sad songs for us to bear 

[BREAK]

[VERSE]
You know sometimes I write happy songs .. but then sometimes little things are wrong
You know I wish they all could make you smile
Tomorrow maybe we can get away .. I'm coming home soon and I want to stay 
I wish you could come with me when I go again 

[CHORUS]
If I could only fly 
If I could only fly 
I'd bid this place goodbye 
To come and be with you
But I can hardly stand
Got nowhere to run
Another sinkin' sun
One more lonely night 

[OUTRO]
If I could only fly 
If you could only fly
If we could only fly 
There'd be no more lonely nights
