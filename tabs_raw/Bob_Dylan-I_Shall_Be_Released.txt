[Verse]
A                              Bm
 They say everything can be replaced
C#m        D        E      A
 Yet every distance is not near
A                    Bm
 So I remember every face
C#m        D       E      A
 Of every man who put me here.


[Chorus]
A                     Bm
 I see my light come shining
C#m        D      E      A
 From the west unto the east.
 A
  Any day now,
 Bm
  Any day now,
C#m       D      A
  I shall be released


[Verse]
 They say every man needs protection.
 They say that every man must fall.
 Yet I swear I see my reflection,
 Someplace so high above this wall.


[Chorus]
 I see my light come shining
 From the west unto the east.
  Any day now,
  Any day now,
  I shall be released


[Verse]
 Well yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
 A man who swears he's not to blame.
 All day long I hear him cry out so loud,
 Calling out that he's been framed.


[Chorus]
 I see my light come shining
 From the west unto the east.
  Any day now,
  Any day now,
  I shall be released
