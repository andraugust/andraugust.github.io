
A                C#7         F#m              D7
Since it costs a lot to win, and even more to lose,
 
A              (chrom. walk) F#   B                 D
You and me got to spend more time wonderin' what to choose.
 

CHORUS
A                 C#7
Goes to show, you don't ever know,
 
F#m        A                 D       D7 
Watch each card you play and play it slow.
 
A               G          D
Wait until that deal come 'round,
 
A                  G       D     A
Don't you let that deal go down, no no.

  
I've been gamblin' hereabouts for ten good solid years,
And if I told you all that went down it would burn off both your ears.

[CHORUS]
 
Since you poured the wine for me and tightened up my shoes,
I hate to leave you sittin' there composing lonesome blues.

[CHORUS]
