[Verse]
            IV             I                      V          IV
I said, "I need a little change". You said you need a little time
      I       I/Ib    VI                IV              V
So I made my way downtown where I could try to clear my mind
  IV              IVm                I      I/Ib    VI
I picked you up a knockoff watch and I came home to find
               I              V                     I     IV I
You filled the bathtub to the brim with nickels and dimes


[Chorus]
            IV                 III                VI
Nickels and dimes, nickels and dimes, nickels and dimes
          I    I/Ib         VI
There's a jackpot up there somewhere
IV                     I
I just can't seem to find
IV  IV    I             V                  I   IV I
And all I ever get from you is nickels and dimes


[Verse]
    IV                  I           IV              I    IV
Then I looked into your eyes, and you looked into mine
From the other room I heard the kettle start to whine
That was long ago, you know the pain cools down with time
By my bed I keep a jar of nickels and dimes


[Chorus]
Nickels and dimes, nickels and dimes, nickels and dimes
There's a jackpot up there somewhere
I just can't seem to find
And all I ever get from you is nickels and dimes

[Verse]
Well I wake up every morning, and I get to work on time
Once a year my boss tells me I'm doing fine
There's a jackpot up there somewhere
Oh, that I don't pay no mind
I just come home at night and count my nickels and dimes


[Chorus]
Nickels and dimes, nickels and dimes, nickels and dimes
There's a jackpot up there somewhere
That I could never find
I come home at night and count nickels and dimes
So I come home at night and count nickels and dimes
