e---7b8b7--5--7/8--9----

CHORUS:
A                  D
Mama said don't go near that river
A                                  E
Don't be hanging round old Catfish John
A                    D
Come the morning I'd always be there
A                               E           A
Walking in his footsteps in the sweet delta dawn


VERSE:
        D               A
Take me back to another morning
     D             A
To a time so long ago
          D              A
Where the sweet magnolia blossomed
A                  E        A
Cotton fields were white as snow


Catfish John was a river hobo
Lived and died by the river's bend
Looking back I still remember
I was proud to be his friend

[CHORUS]

[BREAK]

Born a slave in the town of Richmond
Traded for a chestnut mare
Lord he never spoke in anger
Though his load was hard to bear

[CHORUS]

[CHORUS]

Walking in his footsteps in the sweet Delta dawn
