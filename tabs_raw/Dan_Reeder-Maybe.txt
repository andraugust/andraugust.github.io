Cappo 4 (I is open G)


[VERSE I]

I
First guy I knew who died I can't remember his name 
IV                                       I
10th grade started he just never came a..gain
                                            V
All his friends sat around and cried for a day or two
I
You can say what you want about immortal soul
IV
When that guy died it left a hole 
I                        V                  I
It was my first clue that when they're gone they're gone


[CHORUS]

      IV
Maybe Jesus beat that rap we're not sure
      I
Maybe you can live forever if you're heart is pure
      V                                  I
Maybe you'll come back someday as a king prawn
      IV
Maybe angels come and take you away 
      I
To heaven..or the other way 
              V                                     I
But from down here it appears that when you're gone you're gone


[Verse II]

Me and Stevie Gibson used to walk home from school

He used to have this old turn around rule 

If you turn around one way you turn around the other way or else it's bad luck

Went out raftin on the river.. the river went around and the raft went around and his luck got all wound up

And he drowned and he was gone


[CHORUS]



[VERSE]

Two weeks after Deeter died you could call him on the phone 

He would tell you he's not home

It'd give you an eerie feeling even though you knew it was just an answering machine

Cuz somewhere deep inside you know

They don't come back when they go 

And he had gone and when they're gone they're gone


[CHORUS - ...Come back as a bug in a log]


My mother died in intensive care

We were sitting around singing on folding chairs when I got the feeling somebody wasn't there

Well I counted noses but it came out right

Doctors say she died that night, but I felt that hole and I knew she was gone


[CHORUS]


I looked up death in the dictionary one day 

Just to see what the dictionary had to say

It's the complete and irreversible cease of life functions

Which is not very poetic but it's precise and clean

And if you analyze it.. what that means is when they're gone they're gone


[CHORUS]
