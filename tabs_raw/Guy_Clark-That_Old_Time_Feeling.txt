[Verse 1]
         D   E    A      C#m/G#  F#m      E        A   A/E
And that old time feeling  goes  sneaking down the hall,
        D/F#     E      A      D       F#m/C#       E/B   E
Like an old gray cat in winter keeping close to the wall.
         D   E    A      C#m/G#  F#m       E      A   A/E
And that old time feeling comes  stumbling up the street,
        D/F#  E        A           Bm7    E        A   A/E   A   A/E
Like an old   salesman kicking the papers from his feet.


[Verse 2]
         D   E    A      C#m/G#  F#m      E        A   A/E
And that old time feeling draws circles around the block,
        D/F#     E      A      D       F#m/C#       E/B   E
Like old women with no children holding hands with the clock.
         D   E    A      C#m/G#  F#m    E         A   A/E
And that old time feeling falls on its face in the park,
        D/F#  E        A           Bm7    E        A   A/E   A   A/E
Like an old wino praying he can make it until it's dark.


[Verse 3]
         D   E    A      C#m/G#  F#m      E        A   A/E
And that old time feeling comes and goes in the rain,
        D/F#     E      A      D       F#m/C#       E/B   E
Like an old man with his checkers dying to find a game.
         D   E    A      C#m/G#  F#m  E        A   A/E
And that old time feeling plays for beer in bars,
        D/F#  E        A           Bm7    E        A   A/E   A   A/E
Like an old blues time picker who don't recall who you are.


[Verse 4]
         D   E    A      C#m/G#  F#m      E        A   A/E
And that old time feeling limps through the night on a crutch,
        D/F#     E      A      D     F#m/C#   E/B   E
Like an old soldier wondering if he's paid too much.
         D   E    A      C#m/G#  F#m  E        A   A/E
And that old time feeling rocks and spits and cries,
        D/F#  E        A           Bm7    E        A   A/E   A   A/E
Like an old lover remembering the girl with the clear blue eyes.

[Verse 5]
         D   E    A      C#m/G#  F#m      E        A   A/E
And that old time feeling  goes  sneaking down the hall,
        D/F#     E      A      Bm7     E            A
Like an old gray cat in winter keeping close to the wall.
