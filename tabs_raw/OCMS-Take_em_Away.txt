[Chorus]
I             IV
Take 'em away, take 'em away, Lord
I              V
Take away these chains from me
I                         IV
My heart is broken 'cause my spirit's not free
I                     V           I
Lord, take away these chains from me

[Verse 1]
Some bird feathers are too bright to be caged
I know I'm not that colorful but a bird just the same
Open up your gate now let me put down my load
So I can feel at ease and go back to my home

[Chorus]
Take 'em away, take 'em away, Lord
Take away these chains from me
My heart is broken 'cause my spirit's not free
Lord, take away these chains from me

[Verse 2]
Sun beatin' down my legs can't seem to stand
There's a boss man at a turnrow with a rifle in his hand
I've got nine children, nothin' in the pan
My wife she died hungry while I was plowin' land

[Chorus]
Take 'em away, take 'em away, Lord
Take away these chains from me
My heart is broken 'cause my spirit's not free
Lord, take away these chains from me

[Break]

[Verse 3]
Can't see when I go to work, can't see when I get off
How do you expect a man not to get lost
Every year I just keep getting deeper in debt
If there's a happy day, Lord, I haven't seen one yet

[Chorus]
Take 'em away, take 'em away, Lord
Take away these chains from me
My heart is broken 'cause my spirit's not free
Lord, take away these chains from me

[Verse 4]
Land that I love is the land that I'm workin'
But it's hard to love it all the time when your back is a-hurtin'
Gettin' too old now to push this here plow
Please let me lay down so I can look at the clouds

[Chorus]
Take 'em away, take 'em away, Lord
Take away these chains from me
My heart is broken 'cause my spirit's not free
Lord, take away these chains from me

[Break]

[Verse 5]
The land that I know is where two rivers collide
The Brazos, the Navaso and the big blue sky
Flood plains, freight trains, watermelon vines 
Of any place on Godâ€™s green earth, this is where I choose to die 

[Chorus]
Take 'em away, take 'em away, Lord
Take away these chains from me
My heart is broken 'cause my spirit's not free
Lord, take away these chains from me
