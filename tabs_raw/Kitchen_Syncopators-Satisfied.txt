I used to live in the country on a high lonesome hill
                                        F
Cruel by day and the night a whip a will(?)  x2


[CHORUS]
C7                                G
Well I been, and I am, and I was, mostly satisfied

Said the little red hen to the little red rooster 
You don't come around the chicken shack like you used to  x2

CHORUS

Said the zebra to the camel you're my sugar lump
By the way you handle your hump   x2

CHORUS

I'm goin downtown hat caved in
Come back home with a pocket full of tin   x2

CHORUS

You're my baby you're the one
Throw your arms around me like a circle 'round the sun  x2

G                                          (A)             C
Cus I'm satisfied, tickled too, satisfied, just to be with you
