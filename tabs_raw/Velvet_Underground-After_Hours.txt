[Chorus]
        C         A7
 If you close the door
     Dm                  G
 The night could last forever
           C        A7
 Leave the sunshine out
     Dm             G
 And say hello to never


[Verse]

         C                              C7
 All the people are dancing and they're having such fun
   F                         Fm
 I wish this could happen to me
            C         A7
 But if you close the door
      Dm            G            C
 I'll never have to see the day again

[Chorus]
 But if you close the door
 The night could last forever
 Leave the wine glass out
 And drink a toast to never

[Verse]
 Someday I know someone will look into my eyes
 And say hello
 You're my very special one
 But if you close the door
 I'll never have to see the day again


[Bridge]

 Am         E7          Am       E7
 Dark party bars, shiny Cadillac cars
     Am        E7          Am        Am G# G
 And people on subways and trains
         Dm          A7           Dm         A7
 Looking gray in the rain as they stand disarrayed
       F                       G
 Oh but people look well in the dark


 [Chorus]

 If you close the door
 The night could last forever
 Leave the sunshine out
 And say hello to never


[Verse]
 All the people are dancing and they're having such fun
 I wish this could happen to me
 Cause if you close the door
 I'll never have to see the day again
 I'll never have to see the day again (once more)
 I'll never have to see the day again
