Key of C


I
Moonlight shining through the trees
IV
Moonlight shining down on me
I                                V    V7
Lights the way for lovers in the dark

I
Moonbeams dance on rain-drenched trees
IV
Sparkle for our eyes to see
I                  V                 I  IV  I  V
Moonlight shine on down and shine on me

--

Moonlight bathes the woods around
Paradise that we have found
Here among the trees and things we love

Shines on friends, all far away
Takes us to another day;
Moonlight shine on down and shine on me

BREAK

--

Layin' with the one I love
Lookin' at the moon above
Bein' where we really wanna be

The autumn winds for now are still
The moon shines on, it always will;
Moonlight shine on down and shine on me
Moonlight shine on down and shine on me
