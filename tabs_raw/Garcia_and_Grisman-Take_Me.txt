C                                                                 C7
Take me to your darkest room close every window and bolt every door

F                     C->walk->A               D7    G          C
The very moment, that I heard your voice I’d be in darkness no more


Take me to your most barren desert a thousand miles from the nearest sea
The very moment that I saw you smile it would be like heaven to me


Chorus:
G
There’s not any mountain too rugged to climb nor
D                   G     G7
desert too barren to cross
G
darling if you would just show a sign of
D                      G   G7
love I could bare the load
 

Take me to Siberia in the coldest weather of the winter time
Then it would be just like spring in California to know that your love would be mine


Instrumental: (2x  Guitar)   (2x Mandolin)


Chorus


Take me to Siberia in the coldest weather of the winter time
Then it would be just like spring in California to know that your love would be mine

Then it would be just like spring in California to know that your love would be mine
