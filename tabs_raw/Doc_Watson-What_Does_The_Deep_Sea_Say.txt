
INTRO

She stood on the beach alone
And gaze at the misty blue
Deep sea, as you hold him to your breast
Does he mention my name to you?

Oh, where is my sailor boy?
Where is my sailor boy?
He sleeps at the bottom of the deep blue sea
And he can't come back to me

Oh, what does the deep sea say?
What does the deep sea say?
It moans it groans it splashes and it foams
And it rolls on its weary way

FIDDLE

Oh, please tell me, deep blue sea
Is he sleeping peacefully?
The winds from the north are blowin' icy cold
Can you keep him warm for me?

If only my grieving soul
Some token of love could find
If only the waves would show me where he sleeps
Then I'd leave this world behind

CHORUS

MANDO & BANJO

A beautiful rose one day
I placed on the crest of a wave
I said "Take it please and let it settle home
Above his watery grave"

The driftwood I watched in vain
And my rose never came back again
Oh, waves, take another message to my love
Sayin' I'll meet him above

Oh, what does the deep sea say?
What does the deep sea say?
It goards and keeps my lover where he sleeps
And it rolls on its weary way
