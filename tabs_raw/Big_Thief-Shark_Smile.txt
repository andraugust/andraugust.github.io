[Verse]
G                          C/G
She was a shark smile in a yellow van
D/A                   G       D/F#
She came around and I stole a glance
      Em
In my youth, a vampire
             D/A            C/G
Evelyn shown quiet as roses sting

[Verse]
It came over me at a bad time
But who wouldn't ride on a moonlight line?
I had her in my eye, 85 down the road of a dead-end gleam

[Chorus]
             G
And she said woo
D/F#  Am         C/G
Baby, take me

And I said woo
Baby, take me too

[Verse]
It came over her at a bad time
Riding through Winona down the dotted line
Held us gunning out 90 miles down the road of a dead end dream

[Verse]
She looked over with a part smile
Caught up in the twinkle, it could take awhile
And the money pile on the dashboard fluttering

[Chorus]
As she said woo
Baby, take me
And I said woo
Baby, take me too

[Interlude]
| G   | C/G | D/A | G  D/F#|
| Em  | Em/B| D/A | C/G | C/G |

[Verse]
Evelyn's kiss was oxygen
I leaned over to take it in
As we went howling through the edge of south Des Moines

It came over me at a bad time
She burned over the double line
And she impaled as I reached my hand for the guardrail
  | C/G D/A |   C/G
Ooh the guardrail
  | C/G D/A |   C/G  C/G
Ooh the guardrail

[Chorus]
As she said woo
Baby, take me

And I said woo
Baby, take me too

As she said woo
Baby, take me

And I said woo
Baby, take me too
