Capo 1


D and Em are circular walks:

D  -> D  Dmaj7    D6  Dmaj7
Em -> Em Em(maj7) Em7 Em(maj7)


D                                                                   Em
It's knowing that your door is always open and your path is free to walk
     Em                                                   A                   D
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag rolled up and stashed behind your couch
         D                                                               D                                   Em
And it's knowing I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds - And the ink stains that are dried upon some line
     Em                                             A             Em             A            D
That keeps you in the backroads by the rivers of my memory - That keeps you ever gentle on my mind


It's not clinging to the rocks and ivy planted on their columns now that bind me

Or something that somebody said because they thought we fit together walking

It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing or forgiving when I walk along some railroad track and find

That you're moving on the backroads by the rivers of my memory - And for hours you're just gentle on my mind


Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines and the junkyards and the highways come between us

And some other woman's cryin to her mother cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face - And the summer sun might burn me til I'm blind

But not to where I cannot see you walkin' on the backroads - By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind


I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin cracklin' caldron in some train yard

My beard a roughing coal pile, and a dirty hat pulled low across my face

Through cupped hands round the tin can I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
                                                                      
That you're waveing from the backroads by the rivers of my memories - Ever smilin ever gentle on my mind
