Once upon a time there was an engineer
G                       A7       D7
Drove a locomotive both far and near
G                                 C
Accompanied by a monkey who would sit on his stool
G             A               D        G   
Watching everything the engineer would do


One day the engineer wanted a bite to eat

He left the monkey sittin' on the driver's seat

The monkey pulled the throttle, locomotive jumped the gun

And did ninety miles an hour down the main line run


G              C        G
Big locomotive right on time
G                     A7         D7
Big locomotive comin' down the line
G                     C 
Big locomotive number ninety-nine
G            A7         D7      G
Left the engineer with a worried mind



The Engineer called up the dispatcher on the phone

Tell him all about his locomotive was gone

Get on the wire, switch operator to write

Cause the monkey's got the main line sewed up tight


Switch operator got the message on time

Said, there's a northbound livin' on the same main line

Open up the switch, I'm gonna let her through the hole

Cause the monkey's got the locomotive under control



Big locomotive right on time

Big locomotive comin' down the line

Big locomotive number ninety-nine

Left the engineer with a worried mind
