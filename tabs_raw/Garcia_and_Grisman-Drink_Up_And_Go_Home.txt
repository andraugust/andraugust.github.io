I
You sit there a-crying, crying in your beer

                  IV                          V
You think you got troubles, my friend listen here

                   IV                               I
Don't tell me your troubles, I've got enough of my own

                   IV     V                   I
Be thankful you're living, drink up and go home

                 IV                        I
I'm fresh out of prison, six years in the pen

                 IV                      V  
Lost my wife and family, no one to call friend

                   IV                               I
Don't tell me your troubles, I've got enough of my own

                   IV     V                I
Be thankful you're living, drink up and go home

Now there sits a blind man, so blind he can't see

                     IV                            V
Do you think he's complaining, why should you and me?

                   IV                               I
Don't tell me your troubles, I've got enough of my own

                   IV     V                I
Be thankful you're living, drink up and go home
                   IV     V                I
Be thankful you're living, drink up and go home
