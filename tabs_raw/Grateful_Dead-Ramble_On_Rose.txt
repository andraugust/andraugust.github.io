
D                        
Just like Jack the Ripper
E 
Just like Mojo Hand
F#m       G 
Just like Billy Sunday
G                    A
In a shotgun ragtime band 


Just like New York City,
Just like Jericho
Pace the halls and climb the walls
Get out when they blow


[CHORUS]
D                           
Did you say your name was
G
Ramblin' Rose? 
E
Ramble on, baby
G	     D
Settle down easy
A           D
Ramble on, Rose

Just like Jack and Jill
Mama told the sailor
One heat up and one cool down
Leave nothin' for the tailor

Just like Jack and Jill
My Papa told the jailer
One go up and one come down
Do yourself a favor

[CHORUS]

[BRIDGE]
Bm                C 
I'm gonna sing you a hundred verses in ragtime
Bm                  	  C           G
I know this song it ain't never gonna end
Bm				C
I'm gonna march you up and down along county line
D               A             Bm     E   A
Take you to the leader of the band 

Just like Crazy Otto
Just like Wolfman Jack
Sittin' plush with a royal flush
Aces back to back

Just like Mary Shelley
Just like Frankenstein
Clank your chains and count your change
Try to walk the line

[CHORUS]

Goodbye, Mama and Papa
Goodbye, Jack and Jill
The grass ain't greener, the wine ain't sweeter
either side of the hill.

[CHORUS]
