Key of G

[Chorus]
I                                         IV
There ain't nobody gonna miss me when I'm gone
      I                                   V7
There ain't nobody gonna mourn for me too long
          I                         IV
Won't you write these words upon my headstone
      I                  V7               I
There ain't nobody gonna miss me when I'm gone


[Verse]
Once I had a little sweetheart I loved dearly
We planned the day that she would be my own
Some other man he stole my darlin' from me
Now there ain't nobody gonna miss me when I'm gone

[Chorus]


[Verse]
Once I had a lovin' mother dear and daddy
But now they're in the land where angels dwell
They have found eternal rest way up in heaven
Where I'll find my reward no one can tell

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Now you’ve been faithful kind and true to me old Copper
You’re the only one that’s never done me wrong
I am weeping while I pat your head old Copper
For there ain’t nobody gonna miss me when I’m gone
