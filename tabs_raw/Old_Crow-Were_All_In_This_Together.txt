[Intro]

D  F#  G D Bm  A
D  F#  G D Bm  A G


[Verse 1]

D       F#       G                 D
Well my friend, I see your face so clearly
Bm                       A
Little bit tired, little worn through the years
D         F#       G        D
You sound nervous, you seem alone
Bm                           A                 G
I hardly recognize your voice on the telephone


In between I remember
Just before we wound up broken-down
We drive out to the edge of the highway
Follow that lonesome dead-end road sign south


[Chorus]

We're all in this thing together
Walkin' the line between faith and fear
This life don't last forever
When you cry I taste the salt in your tears


[Verse 2]

Come my friend, let's put this thing together
And walk the path our worn out feet have trod
If you want, we could go on forever
Give up your jaded ways, spell your name to God


[Chorus]

We're all in this thing together
Walkin' the line between faith and fear
This life don't last forever
When you cry I taste the salt in your tears


[Bridge]

All we are is a picture in a mirror
Fancy shoes to grace our feet
All there is is a slow road to freedom
Heaven above and the devil beneath


[Chorus]

We're all in this thing together
Walkin' the line between faith and fear
This life don't last forever
When you cry I taste the salt in your tears
