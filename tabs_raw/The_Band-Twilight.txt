Capo 1

Reggae feel


[Verse]
A           D   A      F#m
Over by the wildwood -  Hot summer night
Bm                         E               E7
We lay in the tall grass  til the mornin' light


[Verse]
If I had my way I'd never  -  get the urge to roam
A young man serves his country and an old man guards the home


[Pre-Chorus -> Chorus]
A                  D          A
Don't send me no distant salutations
A                     D     Bm
or silly souvenirs from far away
E                                  E7
Don't leave me alone in the twilight
E                                    A
Cause Twilight is the loneliest time a day


D   A  E7 A


[Verse]
Never gave a second thought  -  Never crossed my mind
What's right and what's not  -  I'm not the judgin' kind

[Verse]
I could take the darkness oh  -  Storms in the skies
But we all got certain trials burnin' up inside

[Pre-chorus]
Don't put me in a frame upon the mantel
'Fore memories turn dusty old and grey

--> 

    Don't leave me alone in the twilight
    Twilight is the loneliest time a day

    D  A  E7  F#m    D  A  E  A  E7
