      D       A         G            D
Did I see you down in a young girl's town,
                            A
with your mother in so much pain?
      G      A            Bm         E
I was almost there at the top of the stairs,
         D                A    D
with her screamin' in the rain


Did she wake you up to tell you that,
it was only a change of plan?
Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup,
with the promise of a man.


Did I see you walking with the boys,
though it was not hand in hand?
And was some black face in a lonely place,
when you could understand?


Did she wake you up to tell you that,
it was only a change of plan?
Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup,
with the promise of a man.


Will I see you give more than I can take?
Will I only harvest some?
As the days fly past will we lose our grasp,
or fuse it in the sun?


Did she wake you up to tell you that,
it was only a change of plan?
Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup,
with the promise of a man.


Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup,
with the promise of a man.
