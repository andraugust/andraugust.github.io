D  A  E  D
D  A  E  D


[Verse]
D                                   A
Good to hear you're feeling better
      E         D
But I still got ways
D                                     A
Oh, to be where the weather's wetter
                       E
With a stomach settled
                              D
And a mouthful of great lake


[Pre-Chorus]
Bm                            E
Way too much to buckle under
Bm                                       E
You can almost smell the stolen thunder

      A                    C#m
Still I, I got a lingering love for this place
                       Em                  D
Let's turn the plane around, I don't wanna give up


[Verse]
I used to think I needed order
But not so much anymore
Always cautious around the corners
Always feeling like a foreigner
Knocking at the locked door


[Pre-Chorus]
Passing cars and rolling thunder
Passing cars and rolling thunder


[Chorus]
Still I, I got a lingering love for this place
Let's turn the plane around, I don't wanna give up
'Cause I, I got a lingering love for this place
                    Bm
I gotta a lingering love for this place
Dm          A
I, I, I, I, I...


[Instrumental]
A  C#m  Em  D


[Chorus]
Still I, I got a lingering love for this place
Let's turn the plane around, I don't wanna give up
'Cause I, I got a lingering love for this place
I gotta a lingering love for this place
Dm          D    A   E   D
I, I, I, I, I...


[Outro]
D                                   A
Good to hear you're feeling better
      E               D
But I still got ways
