F#m   Bm   C#    F#m

  F#m            C#        Em            G
I turn and walk away then I come 'round again
   D               A                C#              F#m
It looks as though tomorrow I'll do pretty much the same.

I must turn down your offer but I'd like to ask a break
You know I'm ready to give everything for anything I take.

F#  Bm  C#

[VERSE]
E                          D      A                D    A
Someone called my name you know I turned around to see
       Bm              E       A       D                  E        D     E
It was midnight in the Mission and the bells were not for me, come again


[CHORUS]
Bm       C#m         D              A    G    D
walking along in the Mission in the rain come again
Bm       C#m         D              A
Walking along in the Mission in the rain

[VERSE]
Ten years ago, I walked this street my dreams were riding tall
Tonight I would be thankful Lord for any dream at all

[VERSE]
Some folks would be happy just to have one dream come true
But everything you gather is just more that you can lose, come again

[CHORUS]
Walking along in the Mission in the rain come again
Walking along in the Mission in the rain

[BREAK]

[VERSE]
All the things I planned to do I only did half way
Tomorrow will be Sunday born of rainy Saturday

[VERSE]
There's some satisfaction in the San Francisco rain
No matter what comes down the Mission always looks the same, come again

[CHORUS]
Walking along in the Mission in the rain come again
Walking along in the Mission in the rain
