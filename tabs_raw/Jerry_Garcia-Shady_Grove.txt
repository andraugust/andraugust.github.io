"Shady Grove"
Lyrics from Grisman and Garcia
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cappo 2

Am                   G
Peaches in the summertime
Am            C
Apples in the fall
C                  G
If I can't get the girl I love
G                    Am
I don't want none at all (note 1)

[CHORUS]
Am                     G
Shady grove, my little love
Am             C
Shady grove, I say-ee
C            G
Shady grove, my little love
G                Am
I'm bound to go away

Wish I had a banjo string
Made of golden twine
Every tune I'd play on it (note 2)
I wish that girl were mine

[CHORUS]

Wish I had a needle and thread (note 3)
Fine as I could sew
I'd sew that pretty girl to my side
And down the road I'd go

[CHORUS]

Some come here to fiddle and dance
Sme come here to tarry
Some come here to fiddle and dance
I come here to marry

[CHORUS]

Every night when I go home (note 4)
My wife, I try to please her
The more I try, the worse she gets
Damned if I don't leave her

[CHORUS]

Fly around, my pretty little miss (note 5)
Fly around, my Daisy
Fly around, my pretty little miss
Nearly drive me crazy

[CHORUS]
