A	F#m	C#m	E7


A
Some would say the bottle's half empty

F#m
But I say my stomach's half full

C#m
Some would say I drank the day away

E7
But I'd say I've got the night still



And another bottle in the cabinet

Will give me another thrill

You might say that drinking won't cure me

But I'm quite sure it will


CHORUS
A                               F#m               Bm    D
And the spirit in the bottle is sure to serve its master

A                       F#m            Bm       D
I've got me a genie and my wish is to get plastered

A      F#m    Bm
I don't need society

A      F#m    D
I don't need sobriety

D                       E7             A
When that spirit in the bottle sets me free



Some would say that I am the slave

And the bottle owns me

Some would say it's gonna take me to my grave.  

Some say it'll drown me in the sea



But me I know much better.  

It's the liquor that keeps me alive.

And whenever that whiskey pumps through my veins 

I know I will survive.
