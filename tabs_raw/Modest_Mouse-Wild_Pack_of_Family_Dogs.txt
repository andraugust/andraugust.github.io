A wild pack of family dogs came runnin through the yard one day
My father got his gun, shot it up they ran away ok

A wild pack of family dogs came runnin through the yard and as my 
own dog ran away with them I didnt say much of anything at all...
Didn't say much of anything at all...
Didn't say much of anything at all...

A wild pack of family dogs came runnin through the yard
As my little sister played the dogs took her away and
I guess she was eaten up ok yeah she was eaten up ok
My mothers cryin blood dust now...
My mothers cryin blood dust now...
My mothers cryin blood dust now...

My daddy quit his job today I guess he was fired but thats ok
And Im sitting outside by my mud lake waiting for the pack to take me away
Right after I die, the dogs start running up towards the glowing sky

Now they will receive their rewards...
Now they will receive their rewards...
Now they will receive their rewards...
