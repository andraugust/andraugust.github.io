G D Bm C G

[Verse]
                        D
Days are short, and I ain't down
     Am
The sun is on the hill
C               D               G
Looking in my suitcase for a friend
                      D
The door was opened wide
            Am
You know I lost a little pride
        C          D            G
And inside it was just another man


[Chorus]
        Em         C            D       G
Every day another man reaches out his hand
        C               A                   D
Every moment there's a shifting in the sand
        C               D
Every whisper in the wind
        G       F#m      Em
Brings a good man back again
G                       D
Settle me down in my dreams tonight
Am          Bm      Cm        Eb   G
Tomorrow's another day to blow my blues away

[Verse]
Lots of folks will tell you that
A man can go thru' life
Taking what he wants along the way
But until all men are freed
Each one gets but what he needs
The experience of living every day

[Chorus]

[Solo]
D Am C D G
D Am F C D G

[Outro]
                D
I woke up this morning
         Am
I awoke upon my knees
Bm      C         D                  G
Crying oo-wee, I don't know where I am
                     D
I feel just like a clown
        Am
Every time I move around
         C              D               G
Because, after all, I'm just another man

[Chorus]
