[Verse 1]
     G              D        C                      G
When I woke up this mornin',   things were lookin' bad
C                   G               D        C      G
  seemed like total silence was the only friend I had
D                   C                 G       C   G
  a bowl of oatmeal tried to stare me down... and won
           D                       C                   G      C  G
and it was twelve o'clock before I realized that I was havin' no fun


[Pre-Chorus]
        D                 G                 C     D   G
Ah, but fortunately... I have the key to escape reality

[Chorus] (Change to 3/4 time, and slow down to 130 bpm)
            C                      G
and you may see me tonight with an illegal smile
         D                      G
it don't cost very much, but it lasts a long while
          C                            G
won't you please tell the man I didn't kill anyone
         D              C            G   C G C G  C
no I was just tryin' to have me some fun

[Instrumental] (Change back to 4/4 time, speed up to 160 bpm)

[Verse 2]
Last time I checked my bankroll, well it was gettin' thin
sometimes it seems like the bottom is the only place I've been
chased a rainbow down a one-way street... dead end
and all my friends turned out to be insurance salesmen


[Pre-Chorus]


[Verse 3]
Well, I sat down in my closet with all my overalls
just tryin' to get away from all the ears inside the walls
dreamed the police heard everything I thought... what then?
well I went to court and the judge's name was Hoffman

[Pre-Chorus]
(well done, hot-dog bun, my sister's a nun)
