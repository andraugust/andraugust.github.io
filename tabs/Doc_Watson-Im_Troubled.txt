D                             G           D
Our meeting is a pleasure and partying is grief 
                          A              D
But a false hearted lover is worse than a thief        
A thief can but rob you and take what you save 
But a false hearted lover take you to your grave

[CHORUS]                              
I'm troubled I'm troubled I'm troubled in mind 
If trouble don't kill me I'll live a long time

A grave will decay you and turn you to dust 
Ain’t a girl in a million that a poor boy can trust
They'll hug and kiss you and tell you more lies 
As the crossties on the railroad or stars in the sky

CHORUS

I'm going to Georgie I'm going to roam
I'm going to Georgie to make it my home
Gonna build me a cabin on a mountains so high
Where the wild birds and the turtle doves can hear my sad cry

CHORUS
