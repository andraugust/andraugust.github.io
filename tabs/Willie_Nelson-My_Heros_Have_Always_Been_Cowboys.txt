D
I grew up dreaming of being a cowboy
G                 D
Loving the cowboy ways
 
Pursuing the life of my high riding heroes
  E7                     A7
I burned up my childhood days

  D
I learned all the rules of the modern day drifter
          G                     D
Don't you hold onto nothing too long
     G                           D
Just take what you need from the ladies
     G              D          A7          D
Then leave them the words of a sad country song


[Chorus]

    G                       D
My heroes have always been cowboys
E7                    A7
And they still are it seems
G                   D               G
Sadly in search of but one step in back of
    D                A7          D
Themselves and their slow moving dreams


Cowboys are special with their own brand of misery
From being alone too long
You could die from the cold in the arms of a nightmare
Knowing well your best days are gone

Picking up hookers instead of my pen
I let the words of my years fade away
Old worn out saddles old worn out
Memories with no one and no place to stay


[Chorus]

My heroes have always been cowboys
And they still are it seems
Sadly in search of  but one step in back of
Themselves and their slow moving dreams
