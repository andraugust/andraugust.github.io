Em                        G
Woke up on the side of an old desert highway

Em                            G
With the sun in my eye from a tear in the sky where I lay

Am                     Em
Took a look around all I could see was ground

Am                Em
Wind in my ear was all to hear

How did I ever get this far away


Climbed the nearest hill to see what I may
Saw a sign in the distance pointing one way
Followed the road till dehydration took hold
Fell on the spot and then I though
How did I ever get this far away


*Intro Riff (as interlude)*


Then there was a man towering over me
He said hey son you aint where you should be
The mountains to the east are a craggy beast
The dunes to the west are hell at best
How did you ever get this far away

In the middle of the night he had left without pity
I was alone at the beginning of my journey
With no one to guide I'll have to turn to myself
Pick a route and get the hell out
Now I will never be this far away
