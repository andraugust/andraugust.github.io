C                                          F
Mammas don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
      G
Don't let them pick guitars and drive in old trucks
                                    C
Make 'em be doctors and lawyers and such
                                           F
Mammas don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
        G
They'll never stay home and they're always alone
                       C
Even with someone they love
 
                                                 F
Cowboys ain't easy to love and they're harder to hold
    G                                              C
And they'd rather give you a song than diamonds or gold
                                               
Lone Star belt buckles and old faded Levis 
         F
And each night begins a new day
       G
And if you don't understand him and he don't die young
                         C
He'll probably just ride away
  

CHORUS

Cowboys love smokey old pool rooms and clear mountain mornings
Little warm puppies and children and girls of the night
Them that don't know him won't like him 
And them that do sometimes won't know how to take him
He's not wrong he's just different and his pride won't let him
Do things to make you think he's right

Repeat #1
