"On the Road Again" - Willie Nelson

[Chorus]
E                                                       G#7
On the road again, just can't get wait to get on the road again.
                        F#m
I find love is makin' music with my friends.
        A                        B             E
And I can't wait to get on the road again.


[Verse] (Same as chorus)
On the road again, going places that I've never been.
Seein' things that I may never see again.
And I can't wait to get on the road again.


[Bridge]
        A                                                       E
On the road again, like a band of gypsies we go down the highway
             A                                                    E                  B
We're the best of friends, insisting that the world keep turnin' our way, and our way.


[Chorus]
On the road again, just can't get wait to get on the road again.
I find love is makin' music with my friends.
And I can't wait to get on the road again.


[Solo]
E G#7 F#m A B E 
E G#7 F#m A B E


[Bridge]
On the road again, like a band of gypsies we go down the highway
We're the best of friends, insisting that the world keep turnin' our way, and our way.


[Chorus]
On the road again, just can't get wait to get on the road again.
I find love is makin' music with my friends.
And I can't wait to get on the road again. And I can't wait to get on the road again.
