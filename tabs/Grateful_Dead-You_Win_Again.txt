The news is out - all over town

That you've been seen - out runnin round

I know that I - should leave, but then

I just can't go - you win a - gain.

Bridge:
This heart of mine - could never see
What everybody - knew but me
Just trusting you - was my great sin
What can I do - you win a- gain.

2nd verse:
Im sorry for - your victim now
Cause soon his head - like mine will bow
Hell give his heart - but all in vain
And someday say - you win again.

2nd bridge:
You have no heart - you have no shame
You take true love - and give the blame
I guess that I - should not complain
I love you still - you win again.
