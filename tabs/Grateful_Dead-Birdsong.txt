E                                                  
All I know is something like a bird within her sang
E                                                  
All I know she sang a little while and then flew off
C    G  G   D              D    A                 E
Tell me all that you know, I'll show you snow and rain


If you hear that same sweet song again, will you know why
Anyone who sings a tune so sweet is passin' by

Laugh in the sunshine, sing, cry in the dark, fly through the night

C#m       B    A     E   B     A    E   B           A              E
Don't cry now, don't you cry, don't you cry anymore, la-da-da-da       
Sleep in the stars, don't you cry, dry your eyes on the wind, la-da-da-da-da
