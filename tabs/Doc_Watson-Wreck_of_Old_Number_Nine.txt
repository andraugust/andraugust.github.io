*Note on the notation - Everywhere a letter appears (in 
the tab, not above it), strum the corresponding chord in
the general area that it is marked (typically two or three
strings).  For the most part, it is ok (and sometimes even 
desirable) to play sloppy as long as the appropriate chord 
is being held.*

[C] One dark stormy night not a [F] star was in sight
The [C] North wind came howling down the [G] line
There stood a [C] brave engineer with his [F] sweetheart so dear
And his [C] orders to [G] pull old Number [C] Nine.

She [G7] kissed him goodbye with a [C] tear in her [C7] eye
The [F] joy in his [C] heart he couldn't [G] hide
The [C] whole world seemed right for she [F] told him that night
That [C] tomorrow she'd [G] be his blushing [C] bride.

[1/2 RIFF]

The wheels hummed a song as the train rolled along
The black smoke came pouring from the stack
The headlight a-gleam seemed to brighten his dream
Of tomorrow when he'd be goin' back.

He sped around the hill and his brave heart stood still
The headlight was shining in his face
He whispered a prayer as he threw on the air
For he knew this would be his final race.

[RIFF & SOLO]

In the wreck he was found lying there on the ground
He asked them to raise his weary head
His breath slowly went as this message he sent
To a maiden who thought she would be wed.

"There's a little white home that I built for our own
Where I dreamed we'd be happy, you and I
But I leave it to you for I know you'll be true
Til we meet at the Golden Gate - goodbye."
