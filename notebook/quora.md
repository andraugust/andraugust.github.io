<br />
The Quora Insincere Question Classification challenge provides a dataset of questions asked on [quora.com](https://www.quora.com/) and a binary label indicating if each question is _sincere_. The goal is to develop a model that accuartely labels a set of testing questions.  This post documents my development of such a model.

## Data Exploration
What are some sincere questions?

```
A few things to note:
- Questions with commas are surrounded by quotes.  We'll eventually want to remove these.
- Some samples are mis-labeled, e.g., `have you licked the skin of a corpse` or `Is Gaza slowly becoming Auschwitz, Dachau or Treblinka for Palestinians?`.
- Some words aren't separated by space, e.g. `..OS as well as for data storage.will the data..`, we'll probably ignore these since they won't have an embedding.
- Sincere questions tend to ask about how to do something, e.g., `Can you make Amazon Alexa trigger events in the browser?`, or about advice regarding something legal or technical, e.g., `What should I know before visiting Mcleodganj and doing the Triund trek?` and `What do I need to know about buying a car in South Africa as an American?`.

```
A few things to note:
- Insincere questions tend to be about politics or religion or sex, and often make broad generalizations about groups of people, e.g., `Why Italian so narcist with their own food,...` and `If Hispanics are so proud of their countries, why do they move out?`.
- Insincere questions seem more likely to be premised on an opinion than a fact, e.g., `Why are South Indian dishes which are prepared by North Indians more tasty than dishes prepared by South Indian restaurants?`.
- Some samples are mislabelled, e.g., `Whenever we missed a dose of ephedrine, could we take 2 doses at once?`, but it seems there are fewer mislabels here compared to the sincere set, this is may be what motivated the challenge!

How many samples are there?
- Train: 1,306,122
- Test: 56,372

What's the class bias?
- 1/0 = 80,810/1,225,312 = 0.066
