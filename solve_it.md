* START SIMPLE: Solve the 'two-body problem' before solving the 'n-body problem'.

* CHECK YOUR ASSUMPTIONS: These will bite you in the a$$.

* Start with what you know: It's surprising how often solutions arise from simply applying logical steps to things you already know.

* Do an example: Specific instances are usually easier than general ones, and they usually generalize well.

* Work with pointers: If data is scattered in folders, then it's easier to work with a list of train/val paths than it is to move data to designated train/val folders.

* Don't re-invent the wheel: Someone has probably already written the function you need, and it's probably more efficient than your DIY.

* Write it as an equation: Sometimes it's easier to see what's going on in symbolic form.

* Don't write it as an equation: Sometimes equations convolute otherwise simple concepts.

* If you've spent a lot of time trying to understand something, and usually you would have understood it by now, then maybe that something isn't actually a real thing.
