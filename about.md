    <!-- <p> "The tool should be charming, it should be elegant, it should be worthy of our love. This is no joke, I am terribly serious about this. In this respect the programmer does not differ from any other craftsman: unless he loves his tools it is highly improbable that he will ever create something of superior quality." - Dijkstra <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/ewd00xx/EWD32.PDF">EWD32</a></p> -->
