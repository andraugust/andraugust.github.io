<p align="center"><img src="me_tree.jpg"></p>

Welcome to my data science notebook.  Here is where I take notes, document things I've done, and give others something to learn from.  Info about my technical background is on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-august" target="_blank">Linkedin</a>.  Thanks for visiting!
