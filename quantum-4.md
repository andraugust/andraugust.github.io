## Composite Systems & Entanglement

To describe a quantum system composed of multiple otherwise isolated systems, we use multiply-indexed state vectors. For example, if a composite system consists of two objects, one having 3 possible states and another having 2, then the composite system is defined in terms of six basis vectors: $$\ket{00}$$, $$\ket{01}$$, $$\ket{02}$$, $$\ket{10}$$, $$\ket{11}$$, $$\ket{12}$$. The first symbol in the ket denotes the first object's contribution to the overall state and the second symbol denotes the second object's contribution. Together they describe a _single_ possible measurement outcome for the composite system.

As with isolated systems, composite states are linear combinations of basis vectors. For example, if a composite system has two subsystems (which is the number of subsystems we'll exclusively look at in this post), we get


$$
\ket{\psi}=\sum_{ij}a_{ij}\ket{ij}
$$


States are subject to the usual normalization constraint


$$
\sum_{ij} \lvert a_{ij} \rvert^2 = 1
$$


and coefficients have the usual probabilistic interperetation where $$\lvert a_{ij} \rvert^2$$ is the probability that a measurement of the first system returns state $$i$$ and a measurement the second system returns state $$j$$.

In terms of naming conventions, it's standard to call the first subsystem Alice and the second one Bob, and if there's a third it's called Charlie.

__Observables.__ How are observables represented for composite systems? The same way they are for isolated systemsâ€”with operators. But now each subsystem has its own set of operators which act independently on the corresponding part of the subsystem.

For example, consider a sytem of two spins. The most general state is


$$
a\ket{00} + b\ket{01} + c\ket{10} + d\ket{11}
$$


In terms of notation I'm using $$0$$ to represent spin-down and $$1$$ to represent spin-up. Also, I'm working in the $$z$$-basis, so what I called $$\ket{+z}$$ in the first set of notes I'm now calling $$\ket{1}$$. The reason for this change is that it's much easier to write $$\ket{11}$$ instead of $$\ket{+z+z}$$, etc.

Alice and Bob have their own separate operaters, corresponding to their separate observables. In particular, Alice has $$\sigma_x$$, $$\sigma_y$$, $$\sigma_z$$, and Bob has $$\tau_x$$, $$\tau_y$$, $$\tau_z$$. In terms of notation, $$\sigma$$ and $$\tau$$ both represent spin observables but different symbols are needed to distinguish Alice's observables from Bob's. An alternate notation is $$\sigma_x^A$$ and $$\sigma_y^B$$, but I prefer writing it without superscripts.

So what do these operators do to states? Here are a few examples:


$$
\begin{align*}
\sigma_z \ket{\psi} &= -a\ket{00} - b\ket{01} + c\ket{10} + d\ket{11} \\
\tau_z \ket{\psi} &= -a\ket{00} + b\ket{01} - c\ket{10} + d\ket{11} \\
\sigma_x \ket{\psi} &= a\ket{10} + b\ket{11} + c\ket{00} + d\ket{01} \\
\end{align*}
$$


The pattern is that $$\sigma$$ acts only on Alice's part of each basis vector and $$\tau$$ acts only on Bob's. The table below summarizes the action of each operator on each basis. 

|                            | $$\ket{0}$$   | $$\ket{1}$$  |
| -------------------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| $$\sigma_x$$ or $$\tau_x$$ | $$\ket{1}$$   | $$\ket{0}$$  |
| $$\sigma_y$$ or $$\tau_y$$ | $$-i\ket{1}$$ | $$i\ket{0}$$ |
| $$\sigma_z$$ or $$\tau_z$$ | $$-\ket{0}$$  | $$\ket{1}$$  |

Strictly speaking, the row header for Alice should be $$\ket{0 \cdot}$$ and $$\ket{1 \cdot}$$, and for Bob it should be $$\ket{\cdot0}$$ and $$\ket{\cdot 1}$$, but I think the idea is clear as it's written.

To calculate the probability that Alice or Bob measure a certain outcome, we sum all the ways that the outcome can be measured. For example, the probability that Alice measures $$\sigma_z = +1$$ is
$$
\begin{align*}
P(\sigma_z=+1) &= \lvert \braket{10}{\psi} \rvert^2 + \lvert \braket{11}{\psi} \rvert^2 \\
&= \lvert c \rvert^2 + \lvert d \rvert^2 
\end{align*}
$$
