## Composite Systems & Entanglement

__States.__ To describe a quantum system composed of several otherwise isolated systems, we use multiply-indexed state vectors. For example, if a composite system consists of two objects, one having 3 possible states and another having 2, then the composite system is spanned by $$3*2$$ basis vectors: $$\ket{00}$$, $$\ket{01}$$, $$\ket{02}$$, $$\ket{10}$$, $$\ket{11}$$, $$\ket{12}$$. Here, the first symbol in the ket denotes the first object's contribution to the overall state and the second symbol denotes the second object's contribution. Together, they describe a _single_ state of the composite system. 

As with non-composite systems, states are linear combinations of basis vectors. For example, if a composite system has two subsystems (which is the number of subsystems we'll exclusively look at), we get
$$
\ket{\psi}=\sum_{ij}a_{ij}\ket{ij}
$$
States are subject to the usual normalization constraint
$$
\sum_{ij}\abs{a_{ij}}^2 = 1
$$
and coefficients have the usual probabilistic interperetation that $$\abs{a_{ij}}^2$$ is the probability that a measurement of the first system returns state $$i$$ and a measurement the second system returns state $$j$$.

In terms of naming subsystems, it's standard to call the first one Alice and the second one Bob, and if there's a third it's usually called Charlie.

__Observables.__ How are observables represented for composite systems? They're represented in the same way as for isolated systemsâ€”with operators. But now each subsystem has its own set of operators which act independently on the corresponding part of the subsystem.

For example, consider a sytem of two spins. The most general state is
$$
\ket{\psi} = a\ket{00} + b\ket{01} + c\ket{10} + d\ket{11}
$$
In terms of notation I'm using $$0$$ to represent spin-down and $$1$$ to represent spin-up. Also, I'm working in the $$z$$-basis, so what I was calling $$\ket{+z}$$ in the first set of notes I'm now calling $$\ket{1}$$. The reason for this change is that it's much cleaner to write $$\ket{11}$$ instead of $$\ket{+z+z}$$, etc.

Alice and Bob have their own separate operaters, corresponding to the measurements they make on their part of the system. In particular, Alice has $$\sigma_x$$, $$\sigma_y$$, $$\sigma_z$$, and Bob has $$\tau_x$$, $$\tau_y$$, $$\tau_z$$. In terms of notation, $$\sigma$$ and $$\tau$$ both represent spin observables, but different symbols are used to distinguish Alice's observable from Bob's. An alternative is to write $$\sigma_x^A$$ and $$\sigma_y^B$$, but I prefer no superscripts.

So what do these operators do to states? Here are a few examples:
$$
\begin{align*}
\sigma_z \ket{\psi} &= -a\ket{00} - b\ket{01} + c\ket{10} + d\ket{11} \\
\tau_z \ket{\psi} &= -a\ket{00} + b\ket{01} - c\ket{10} + d\ket{11} \\
\sigma_x \ket{\psi} &= a\ket{10} + b\ket{11} + c\ket{00} + d\ket{01} \\
\end{align*}
$$
The pattern is that $$\sigma$$ acts according to what's in the first entry of the basis vector, and $$\tau$$ acts according to what's in the second entry. The table below summarizes the action of $$\sigma$$ on each basis

| x            | $$\ket{0}$$ | $$\ket{1}$$ |
| ------------ | ----------- | ----------- |
| $$\sigma_x$$ | $$\ket{1}$$ | 2           |
| $$\sigma_y$$ | 2           | 2           |
| $$\sigma_z$$ | 2           | 2           |
